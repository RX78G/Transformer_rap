Nobody pray for me

Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now Im countin’ this

D’USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, wont you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin Tetris
AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
Its levels to it, you and I know

If Pirus and Crips all got along
Theyd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time Im in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
Brace yourself, Ill take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how Im slingin crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin yo hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where beep hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin for if you aint walkin up, you fuckin punk?
Pickin up the fuckin pump, pickin off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin from AKs, ARs, Ayy, yall—duck!
Thats what Momma said when we was eatin that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in 94, fuck yo truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Aint no peace treaty, just piecin BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure youre corporate or theyll be callin your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit aint no threat
You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d. city
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
If Pirus and Crips all got along
Theyd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time Im in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!—
Wake yo punk-ass up!
It aint nothin but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
Hood 
It aint nothin but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleepin in the living room of my mommas pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin
In fact, I got fired, cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin at the mouth
I was straight tweakin, the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. Comptons Human Sacrifice
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin shit since the 80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One times crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, its Compton
Im still in the hood, loc, yeah thats cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, thats like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, shit
Couple of IVs with the fuckin spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew Im finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap cause yeah, its so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grands where a mothafucka stand
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And its safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin the option
Of livin a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I
Live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust - what?
​m.A.A.d city
Compton
Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn!
You aint the one that got fucked up
What you holdin it for?
Niggas always actin unsensitive and shit

Just lay back and drink that2.2K
Pour up , head shot 
Sit down , stand up 
Pass out , wake up 
Faded , faded 
Now I done grew up round some people livin their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin to make a vow soon
That Ima get fucked up, fillin up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin only two or three shots?
Ima show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, Ima dive in it
Pour up , head shot 
Sit down , stand up 
Pass out , wake up 
Faded , faded 
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that youre nauseous right now
And Im hopin to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
Ima drown in some poison, abusin my limit
I think that Im feelin the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin, the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, Im over-influenced by what you are doin
I thought I was doin the most til someone said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin only two or three shots?
Ima show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
Nigga, why you babysittin only two or three shots?

Aw man… where is she takin me?
Where is she takin me?
All I, All I, All I, All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then youre like me
Makin excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin, why you laugh?
Dont you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-Dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That niggas straight, man, that nigga aint trippin
We gon do the same ol shit
Ima pop a few shots, they gon run, they gon run opposite ways
Fall right in s lap
And he gon tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody
Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?

These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother!
I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I dont contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause its in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, yous a, yous a, yous a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone dont exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely dont tolerate the front
Shit Ive been through prolly offend you, this is Paulas oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA 
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, Ive done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And Im gon shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my powers here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, Im rollin several dice, fuck your life
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all Im inheritin
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
Tell me somethin
You mothafuckas cant tell me nothin
Id rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin bullets, reapin what you sow
And stackin up the footage, livin on the go
And sleepin in a villa
Sippin from a Grammy, walkin in the buildin
Diamond in the ceilin, marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows Ive been goin hammer
Dodgin paparazzi, freakin through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin to Nirvana
Watchin all the snakes, curvin all the fakes
Phone never on, I dont conversate
I dont compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You aint shit without a body on your belt
You aint shit without a ticket on your plate
You aint sick enough to pull it on yourself
You aint rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA
Uh, me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish 
Hit the house lick: tell me, is you wit it, ya bish? 
Home invasion was persuasive 
From nine to five I know its vacant, ya bish 
Dreams of livin life like rappers do 
Back when condom wrappers wasnt cool 
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros 
Then Usher Raymond Let It Burn came on 
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish 
Park the car, then we start rhymin, ya bish 
The only thing we had to free our mind 
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs 
You lookin like a easy come-up, ya bish 
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish 
And thats a lifestyle that we never knew 
Go at a reverend for the revenue
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin
Everybody gon respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And thats just how I feel
Nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
Thats just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
Thats just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
Thats just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
Thats just how I feel
Dreams of livin life like rappers do 
Bump that new E-40 after school 
You know, “Big Ballin With My Homies” 
Earl Stevens had us thinkin rational 
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish 
Another casualty at war, ya bish 
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head 
He said one day Ill be on tour, ya bish 
That Louis Burgers never be the same 
A Louis belt that never ease that pain 
But Ima purchase when that day is jerkin 
Pull off at Churchs, with Pirellis skirtin 
Gang signs out the window, ya bish 
Hopin all of em offend you, ya bish 
They say your hood is a pot of gold 
And we gon crash it when nobodys home
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin
Everybody gon respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say

Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!

Imagine Rock up in them projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus dont miss them stockings
Liquors spillin, pistols poppin
Bakin soda YOLA whippin
Aint no turkey on Thanksgivin
My homeboy just domed a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day Im hustlin
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter nem
Get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bitch
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys dont see my stash
If they do, tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass aint cut
Them serpents lurkin, Blood
Bitches sellin pussy, niggas sellin drugs
But its all good
Broken promises, steal your watch
And tell you what time it is
Take your Js and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin shaded under a money tree
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin
Everybody gon respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And thats just how I feel

I chip a nigga lil bit of nothin
I chip a nigga lil bit of nothin

Walk myself to the court like, Bitch, I did that!, X-rated
Johnny dont wanna go to school no mo, no mo
Johnny said books aint cool no mo 
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin
God bless America, you know we all love him
Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin, he was mobbin, way belligerent and drunk
Talkin out his head, philosophin on what the Lord had done
He said: K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome.
He was lookin for some closure, hopin I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
I cant sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin killed.
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
I catch a nigga leavin service if thats all I got
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, Bitch, I did that!
Aint no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I cant even keep the peace, dont you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, Im bout to speak at this convention, call you back—
Alright, kids, were gonna talk about gun control
 Damn!
Its not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around
Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped in drag with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders—look what you taught us
Its murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trumps in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood

I am a sinner whos probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I dont understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, dont kill my vibe
Bitch, dont kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today Im yelling
Bitch, dont kill my vibe
Bitch, dont kill my vibe

Bitch, dont kill my vibe
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me its painless
You dont know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of his?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me thats amazin
To you thats a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner whos probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me

Things I dont understand

And not compromise the feeling we love
Youre tryin to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And Im lookin right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
Ill let the people know this is somethin you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
Ima break out and then hide every lock
Ima break out and then hide every lock
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me, then put me on stages
To me, thats amazin
To you thats a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner whos probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me

You aint heard the coast like this in a long time
Dont you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
Ill take your girlfriend and put that pussy on the pedestal
Bitch, dont kill my vibe
Bitch, dont kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream its alive
My New Years resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, dont kill my vibe
Bitch, dont kill my vibe
Bitch, dont kill my vibe
Bitch, dont kill my vibe

Ive done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin on my motherfuckin downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon get this rain like its May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infants first steps
I got paid then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now Im talkin to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin and not doin
‘Cause not doin is somethin a nigga not doin
I said fuck tryin and not doin
‘Cause not doin is somethin a nigga not doin
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that Juicy vid
Bitch, I cant motherfuckin stop movin
Go against me, you wont stop losin
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit aint fair
They say Detroit aint got a chance, we aint even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldnt take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody thats better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers everybody
Im so fuckin first class I could spit up on every pilot
The citys my Metropolis, feel it, its metabolic
And Im over niggas sayin theyre the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
Im one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because Im namedroppin, Hall of Fame droppin
And I aint takin shit from nobody unless theyre OGs
‘Cause that aint the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, Im just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, wont look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week
Sean Don
Miscellaneous minds are never explainin their minds
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
Peddlin sin, thinkin maybe when you get old you realize
Im not gonna fold or demise
I dont smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Dont you pop me no fuckin pill
Ima pop you, then give you this
Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin the kids
Im in a destruction mode if the gold exists
Im important like the Pope, Im a Muslim on pork
Im Makavelis offspring, Im the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle em both
The juggernauts all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, Im in Vegas
Who the fuck yall thought its supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin me
Im uncoachable, Im unsociable, fuck yall clubs!
Fuck yall pictures! Your Instagram can gobble these nuts!
Gobble dick up til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
Ive seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin for parties
Playin with Barbies
Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, Im either that or a Marley
I dont smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
Im dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
Im aimin straight for your pelvis
You cant stomach me? You plan on stumpin me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, Im Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas
Climbin 100 mil in front of me
And Im gonna get it even if youre in the way
And if youre in it, better run for Petes sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
Bout whos the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of yall
New niggas just new niggas, dont get involved
And I aint rockin no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvettes anonymous
Im usually homeboys with the same niggas Im rhymin with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron, Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but Im tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They dont wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? Im tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? Youre better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5s with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin prosthetic leg
Bumpin Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast
You could check my name on the books
I Earth Wind & Fire’d the verse, then reigned on the hook
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof
The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spittin this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgetin with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock
Then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissin you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight
Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin in the limelight
It take time to get your mind right
Jay Electricity, PBS Mysteries
In a lofty place tanglin with Satan over history
You can’t say shit to me, الحمد لله‎
It’s strictly by faith that we made it this far
Every second, every minute
Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
Im talkin about dark room, perfume, go, go
I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you aint never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
Youre in the mood for empathy, theres blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And yall curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, dont approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that aint good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
Less I write it down for real, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
I really hope you play this, cause ol girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations youve been takin
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it dont make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out youre gonna need someone
When you figure out its alright here in the city
And you dont run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write em down for real, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin sure my punctuation curve, every letter heres true
Livin my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
Im talkin poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, its you lookin in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, its you lookin for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin, sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, its coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, thats your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and youll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
Im gon ask you one more time, homie
Where is you from? Or it is a problem.

Or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?
Enough with all this talkin.
Matter of fact, get out the van, homie! Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker, homie!

You can smell it when Im walkin down the street
I can dig rappin, but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? 
I swore I wouldnt tell, but most of yall sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell 
Somethings in the water 
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then Id rather be a bum than a motherfuckin baller

Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires

Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… 
Bitch, where you when I was walkin?

Everybodys suicidal, they aint even need my help
This shit is elementary, Ill probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybodys screamin, Compton!
I should probably run for mayor when Im done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin out the court buildin, woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life aint shit but a fat vagina
Screamin, Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin king 
Bitch, where you when I was walkin—Gunshot
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—Gunshot
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin

Damn I got bitches: wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power

Schemin, and let me tell you bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of em in my Chevy, tell em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma coming heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
Im a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh

Boys and girls, I think Ive gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Wont you please believe when I say

What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?
Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, Im your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know its illegal
I dont think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, aint a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... Ah!
I dont talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, thats all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for yall
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write til Im right with God
Wouldnt you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin at the world like, Where do we go?
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho

Huh? We gon be alright
Nigga, we gon be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon be alright
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
Im alright, and youre a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin in the hotel room
I didnt wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin for answers
Round your city, round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you cant make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You dont even got nobody bein honest with you
Breathe til I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade 
And I know it better than most people
I dont trust em anyways
You cant break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin left and right
Workin through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I wont need you
And I tell you 
I hope the sack is full up
Im fuckin, no, Im fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I aint tryna keep you
Cant keep up a conversation
Cant nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a séance?
You are from my past life
Hope youre doin well, bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal comin in and out
Hope youre doin well, bruh
Everybody needs you
Everybody needs you
Ooh, nani nani
This feel like a Quaalude
No sleep in my body
Aint no bitch in my body, ah
New beginnings, ahh
New beginnings, wake up, akh
The suns goin down
Time to start your day, bruh
Cant keep bein laid off
Know you need the money if you gon survive
Every night shit, every day shit
Droppin baby off at home before my night shift
You know I cant hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but dont wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
Thats every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I dont want your conversation
Rollin marijuana, thats a cheap vacation
My every day shit, every night shit, every day shit
All my night, been ready for you all my night
Been waitin on you all my night
Ill buzz you in, just let me know when youre outside
All my night, you been missin all my night
Still got some good nights memorized
And the look backs gettin me right
Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up
On God, you should match it, its that KO
No white lighters til I fuck my 28th up
1998, my family had that Acura
Oh, the Legend
Kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city buildin mansions
All the reverends
Preachin self made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoneys on occasion
After Trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houstons where I waited
Stayin with you when I didnt have a address
Fuckin on you when I didnt own a mattress
Workin on a way to make it outta Texas, every night
Droppin baby off at home before my night shift, yeah
You know I cant hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, but dont wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
See me bummed out, stressed out
Thats just every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I dont want your conversation
Rollin marijuana, thats a cheap vacation
Every day shit, every day shit
Every night shit, every day shit
Every day shit, every day shit
Every day shit, every night shit
Everything black, I dont want black 
I want everything black, I aint need black 
Some white, some black, I aint mean black 
I want everything black 
Everything black, want all things black
I dont need black, want everything black
Dont need black, our eyes aint black
I own black, own everything black
Six in the morn
Fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn 
Thats all I wanna see 
And sometimes I get off watchin you die in vain
Its such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin
But homie, you made me 
Black dont crack, my nigga
Im the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feelin this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
Im African-American, Im African, Im black as the moon
Heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me, dont you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
Youre fuckin evil
I want you to recognize that Im a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but cant take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
Im guardin my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin a killin
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
I said they treat me like a slave, cah me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus member dat
Im the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, its evident that Im irrelevant to society
Thats what youre tellin me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me til Im dead, church me with your fake prophesizing
That Ima be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me, dont you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you Im making a killin?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
I said they treat me like a slave, cah me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus member dat
Im the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listen then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, its generational hatred
Its genocism, its grimy, little justification
Im African-American, Im African
Im Black as the heart of a fuckin Aryan
Im Black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
But fuck you — no, fuck yall, thats as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, dont you?
You hate my people, I can tell cause its threats when I see you
I can tell cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin maliciously, he get a chain then you gon bleed him
Its funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin with Pirus, only death settle the score
So dont matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State Marcus Garvey got all the answers
Or try to celebrate February like its my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!

When the lights shut off and its my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and its my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I woke up this morning and figured Id call you
In case Im not here tomorrow
Im hopin that I can borrow
A peace of mind, Im behind on whats really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
Im fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, thats blood spilled on your hands
My plans rather vindictive
Everybodys a victim in my eyes
When I ride its a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering Get em!
I got em and I aint give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if Ill ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, Im proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever Ima push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me youll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— 
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and its my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled Brendas Got a Baby
Whats crazy was I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin her past and shit?
Well, its completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin for ass and shit
And Ima need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, Im followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite cause he tip me with Es
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get em
Back to where they used to be, then Ill probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin
Then you probably need to beat her, thats how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And Im exhausted, but fuck that Sorry for your loss shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you cant fit the pumps I walk in?
Ill wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure Im not in the song
Cause I dont need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctors approval is a waste of time, I know Im straight
Ill probably live longer than you and never fade away
Ill never fade away, Ill never fade away, I know my fate
And Im on the grind for this cake, Ima get it or die tryin
Im eyein every male gender with intentions of buyin
You lyin to these motherfuckers
Talkin about you can help em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Dont ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you aint shit...
When the lights shut off and its my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and its my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin away?
If its today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin
The scent of a reaper, ensurin that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if Im doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And Im not sure why Im infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe cause Im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin when Ima rest
And youre right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sisters situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin
Thats realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasnt tryin to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like It need to be told
Cursin the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly whatd happen if I aint continue rappin
Or steady bein distracted by money, drugs and 4-5s
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day youll be strong
Fightin for your rights, even when youre wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when Im gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and its my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that youll sing about me forever
Promise that youll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that youll sing about me forever
Promise that youll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that youll sing about me forever
Promise that youll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that youll sing about me forever
Promise that youll sing about me for— ooooh
Ay, ay, ay, where you bout to go?
Nigga, the homies brother—nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!
Hey, come to the store for a nigga, one time.

Fuck! Im tired of this shit! Im tired of fuckin runnin, Im tired of this shit! My brother, homie!
Tired of runnin, tired of huntin
My own kind, but retirin nothin
Tires are steady screechin, the driver is rubbin
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasnt
Dyin of thirst, dyin of thirst, dyin of thirst?
Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin her
Stray bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin patiently, but they couldnt
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is lookin
Its hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
Im like Tre, thats Cuba Gooding
I know Im good at
Dyin of thirst, dyin of thirst, dyin of thirst
How many sins? Im runnin out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin, Im cottonmouth
Money is power 
Yours is ours 
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
Ill show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst
What are we doin? Who are we foolin?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin, choirs is hummin
Tell us to visit, we lie about comin
Now back to business, loadin the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin
The beef is bubblin, its no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dyin of thirst, dyin of thirst, dyin of thirst
Too many sins, Im runnin out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know is takin notes
On takin this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
My best days, I stress days
Say fuck the world, my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed—whats my next crave?
Whatever it is, know its my next grave
Tired of runnin, tired of runnin, tired of tumblin
Tired of runnin, tired of tumblin – backwards
My momma say See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin of thirst, you dyin of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works.
Fuck! I’m tired of this shit!
I’m tired of fuckin runnin, I’m tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know thats not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
Lord God, I come to You a sinner.
And I humbly repent for my sins.
I believe that Jesus is Lord.
I believe you raised Him from the dead.
I would ask that Jesus come into my life.
And be my Lord and Savior.
I receive Jesus to take control of my life.
And that I may live for Him from this day forward.
Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood.
(Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood)
In Jesus name, amen.
Alright now, remember this day
The start of a new life – your REAL life
Miss me with that bullshit 
You aint really wild, you a tourist 
I be blackin out with the purist 
I made a hundred thou, then I freaked it 
I made five-hundred-thou, then I freaked it

Hey, Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up, cmon, cmon
Is the mic on or not? I want the mic
Were bringing up nobody, nobody...
Nobody but the number one rapper in the world
He done traveled all over the world
He came back just to give you some game
All of the little boys and girls, come up here
Come right here, this is for you, come on up
I done been through a whole lot 
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie 
Pray that the holy water dont go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
And 
Huh, when you lookin at me, tell me what do you see?
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, dont seem shy
One day at a time, huh
They wanna say its a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme, uh
These days of frustration keep yall on tuck and rotation 
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of realitys peace 
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me motherfucker I smile-
And 
Uh, and when you lookin at me, tell me what do you see?
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
Illuminated—
All yall come to the front, yall come up to the front
Baby what about you? Come on
Lift up your head and keep moving, turn the mic up
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga
Uh, and when you lookin at me, tell me what do you see?
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
Huh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy dont seem shy
Huh Huh 
Huh Huh 
 Huh Huh 
 Huh one, two, three
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, dont nobody call a medic
Ima do it til I get it right 
I went to war last night 
Ive been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin every other blessin, I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And its evident Im moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body...
Not on my, not while Im up here
Not on my time, kill the music, not on my time
We could save that shit for the streets
We could save that shit, this for the kids, bro
2015, niggas tired of playin victim, dog
Niggas aint trying to play vic— TuTu, how many niggas we done lost?
How many— Yan-Yan, how many we done lost?
No for real, answer the que—, how many niggas we done lost bro?
This—, this year alone
Exactly, so we— we aint got time to waste time, my nigga
Niggas gotta make time, bro
The judge make time, you know that, the judge make time, right?
The judge make time so it ain’t shit
It shouldn’t be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left, dog
On the dead homies, Charlie P, you know that, bro
You know that
It’s— its mando, right, its mando
And I s— I— And I— And I say this because I love you niggas, man
I love all my niggas, bro
Exac— enough said, enough said
And we gon get back to the show and move on, because that shit petty, my nigga
Mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check
We gon do some acapella shit before we get back to-
All my niggas listen, listen to this:
I promised Dave Id never use the phrase fuck nigga
He said, Think about what you saying: Fuck niggas
No better than Samuel on the Django
No better than a white man with slave boats
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My Pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So Ima dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlook the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies dont recognize we been using it wrong
So Ima break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more
Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time
Kendrick Lamar, by far, realest Negus alive1.3K
Uh-uh, fuck that
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age dont exist
Man, I swear my nigga trippin off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope that take the pain away
From the feelin that he feel today
You know when you part of Section.80
You feel like no one can relate
Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
Im in the house party trippin off
My generation sippin cough syrup like its water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
Less it comes with an 808 
PlayStation and some drank 
Lookin around and all I see is a big crowd thats product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebels dream
Yep, her president is Black, she Black too
Purple Label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head, then she look at me
She got ADHD
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age dont exist
Like woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah 
Woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah 
Woah, woah-woah
And then she started
And then she started feelin herself like no one else in this apartment
Beg your pardon? Oh, I rap, baby, how old are you?
She say twenty-two, I say twenty-three, Okay, then we are crack babies, damn
Why you say that? She said, Where my drink at?
Ima tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen, Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside, then she said, Read between the lines, yep
Hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up when the Nuvo start to drown
Her body, and I know the both of us really deep in the mood now
Its nothin we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound 
Of that Bay Area kush, she looked at me, then looked
At it, then she grabbed it, then she said, Get it understood
You know why we crack babies? Because we born in the 80s
The ADHD crazy
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age dont exist
Like woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah 
Woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah 
Woah, woah-woah
You can have all my shine, Ill give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six, just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, shrooms, blow, dro, hoes, whatever you like
You can have all my shine, Ill give you the light
La-di-da-da-a, da-a 
La-da-da-da-di-da-da-a, la-a 
Let me tell you, Im out here
From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more 
Please 
Please 
Please 
Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said I was in the grape van
Uhm—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, lets make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now its Dennys, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, its damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit dont add up, youre making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, Spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
Youre dealing with malpractice, dont kill a good niggas confidence
Just cause he a nerd and you dont know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say Nam Myoho Renge Kyo
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Capn Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet
Ima put you on game for the lames that dont know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy
Scary, scary
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A.
Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldnt let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasnt even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinskyd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I cant fault em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she aint goin back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin
Of weak content and slow jammin
But dont worry, this ones so jammin
You know it, L.A., its so jammin
I be thinkin every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem aint I be drivin, the problem is I be textin
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was bout their friend that just died
Textin and drivin down Mulholland Drive
Thats why Id rather take the 405
I be worried bout my daughter, I be worried bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye, I aint worried bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What Im supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
Im too black, Im too vocal, Im too flagrant
Something smellin like shit, thats the new fragrance
Its just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days Im in my Yeezys, some days Im in my Vans
If I knew yall made plans, I wouldnt have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldnt rap like this again
But the writers block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A thirty-eight-year-old eight-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I dont never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin like Cam
Thank God for me! 
Whole family gettin money, thank God for E!
I love rockin jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when Im workin on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when Im workin on my house
Tell em partys in here, we dont need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dickll do that
She keep pushin me back, good dickll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dickll put your ass to sleep
Get money 
Big, big money 
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker!
I just keep on lovin you, baby
And theres no one else I know can take your pla-, pla-, pla-
Please, no more parties in L.A. 
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh 
No more parties in L.A. 
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
Let me tell you, Im out here from a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far
Swish
Uh, feelin like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers, get they pistols ready
Send em to the cemetery with obituaries
Dont be scared, nigga, is you ready?
Ive been thinkin bout all the Os in my bank account 
X the hoes in my bed is round the same amount 
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin out, huh
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
 Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin like Im Boyar—
Dee, probably sellin D in your local courtyard
Braids like Im O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws
We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze yall like, Doo, doo, I hate yall
When the beef cooked, I ate yall like, Mmm, mmm!
Lets play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9s on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
Ill make that shirt say R.I.P., Im on some shit
If Im not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Dont look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you posed to
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like Im posed to, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff
Barely even conscious, talkin to my conscience
Gettin deeper in these flows like conches
Im on my convict, dont drop bars, I drop prisons
Dont sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin, so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ignance
Unfortunately, I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 oclock with Jigga
And Im thinkin bout signin to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail but when I preach I only hurt their sales
Like youre only gon end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter any fuckin rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park, dirt-ditch-diggin
Burger-flippin, eat, sleep, shittin human bein, you would be in
Trouble to body-double or couple me to these others
Cause comparatively speakin, my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my visions beyond the Hubbles
I huddle with Nubians, new beginnin again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactives goin gold
And so? Great! Do I give a flying duck
If Im applyin love to my rhymin plus alignin us?
Alabamas climbin up—wait! No, I dont give a
Flying duck nothin but a buckshot; ch-pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood-clot
Aint never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show—Yelawolf
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy cause Im high like Michael Jackson, penny loafers
Moonwalkin on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldnt hit that shit with my worst enemys penis
Bitch, when I say this, I mean this
Ho, Im the meanest
Dick so big, its like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw, shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that suck my cock shit
That is my synopsis, ostrichs posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin tears of vodka, prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin chronic, bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein honest, tell me, isnt that ironic?
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker, so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should have stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the mornin on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin, drinkin Henny like Im Kenny Lofton
Outstandin, I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin
You see us scramblin, sellin Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn, this shit tastes like fantastic, uh
You see me comin through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, Ive got the briefcase
The gavel slam, Im a free man, try not to eat ham
Big K.R.I.T., shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the lac with flats
After that, bottles I cant pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love and all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm, slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, Ive been in the business of sinkin ships
Chokin niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, Im taxin if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, 86er nigga, thats my born year
Get the fuck from round here, thats just my country ways
Suckin on your mommas titty, bitchin while I was choppin blade
Grippin grain, fuckin hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my soul, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hopin the world end so they wont have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why cant you?
In order to come up close, youll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, poppin benji tags on your wifeys ass 
Thats out of line, but in livin color?
Im more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers: a true artist
I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it aint too many feelings involved
I see niggas in this bitch stuntin, poppin bottles
Gettin drunk with these bitches, and when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch and really dont know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit, and when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it
I be with bitches that be with bitches that be with niggas with riches
I tell her, Get him, she say, I got you, I say, No, bitch, I said get him
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy, he hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs, its a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin so silly, I smoke color purple, Im up in here feelin like Celie 
Nappy-ass dreads, whats that you say? Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli 
You can get snaked, you can get faked out by the bitch that you feelin
Cause you thought that she was an angel, that bitch aint no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tellin your business, she tell me your business, you tell that bitch what you feelin
All of the beans you be spillin, to you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillins
She know where you hide it tell me where its hidden, she know when youre gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics, and meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she dont get blamed, we dont snatch chains, we find out addresses, and we dont leave messes
Youll only know that its gone when you checkin, then your first thought is to start second guessin
She say, Whats wrong? He say, Nothin, keep restin, she say, Whats missin? How you know somethin missin?
He scratch his head, she say, Get back in bed, and she gave him some head
Boy, you cant trust them bitches, and then she say, Ooh
I see niggas in this bitch stuntin, poppin bottles
Gettin drunk with these bitches, then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches thats with the niggas we followin
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind and tell them hoes, Dont be so obvious!
Mona Lisa, long hair, dont care
She handle the business and dont ever tell, she bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell em, Ooh, daddy, lets go to your place, and if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware, she dont want love, she just want her share
I know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears, and then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people, and they already know him, and then I call Liz, and she say he comin over
I say, Good girl, just remember what I told you, she gave me the salute, I say, Girl, youre a soldier
Were waitin outside, watch him pull up, walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked, they started French kissin so he didnt see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch, music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out of him, piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
Nigga, turn around, I aint here to fuck around, I aint here to fuck around, caught you wit your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin hands up, Liz, thats enough, you can put your hands down
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her, she a good actress, and you a dead actor
Youll be dead after we get what were after, if Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga, but think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she aint for me, nigga, I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drank on me, nigga, she slip somethin in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture, Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga, you fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everythin that you have til you dont even have an opinion, we have your attention
And now youre lookin down a barrel though, nigga, now she lookin for her pantyhose, nigga
We just lookin for the casserole, nigga, but she gon show us where you stash it though, nigga 
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup and a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter, four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin at em both poppin up and take a picture, uh, probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon be admittin that he love her on his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
 Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin in the walls
And he diggin in it like he livin in it, make a new religion with it, man a nigga bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree, sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi? Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the mornin to The Great Gatsby, then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
Im a dog in the wind, Im a pit laughin, Ima call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and Im all jazzy, Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy, bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, dont you ask me bout a motherfuckin double standard, actin
Fuckin on another nigga, thats a negative alone, but you sucked his dick? Thats just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! You fuckin with Waynes? 
Bitch, gimme your phone! 
He on your fuckin ringtone? Is that the shit that you do? Touchin yourself, lookin at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin his interviews, I dont know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder, forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma, daycare after school and she never did charge you
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up, you know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber Im plannin on aimin, goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, Im emotional cause Im in stress, Im not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers thats killin that pussy, Im killin myself
She say, Ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile , Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, Ooh, no emotion , Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah
Love, lets talk about love

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Tell me what you gon do to me
Confrontation aint nothin new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you cant bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I dont even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy cause I aint invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin?
Mothafucka, I dont even like you
Corrupted mans heart with a gift
Thats how you find out who you dealin with
A small percentage who Im buildin with
I want the credit if Im losin or Im winnin
On my momma, thats the realest shit
Love, lets talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? 
I know the feeling haunt you 
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Its getting cold when an ego gets to talkin
I get involved, like a rebound
No control, no, Im switched in the way that you bringin me down
Its a turn on, you didnt wait from me
Leave me alone, keep away from me
And it sounds wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just think for the life, for the days
For the hours and another like breathin
I did it all cause it feel good
Youd leave it all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we were runnin out of time
Love, lets talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? 
I know the feeling haunt you 
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

And I know you feel like, you know

See, family, thats why you feel like you feel
Like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way...
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won’t you burn this muh’fucka?
I dont think I could find a way to make it on this earth

Lifes a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
I dont think I could find a way to make it on this earth
Ill prolly die anonymous, Ill prolly die with promises
Ill prolly die walkin back home from the candy house
Ill prolly die because these colors are standin out
Ill prolly die because I aint know Demarcus was snitchin
Ill prolly die at these house parties, fuckin with bitches
Ill prolly die from witnesses leavin me falsed accused
Ill prolly die from thinkin that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin the line, actin too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
Ill prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein too lax
Or die from waitin on it, die cause Im movin too fast
Ill prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
Ill prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin
Ill prolly die cause thats what you do when youre 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things
If I could smoke fear away, Id roll that mothafucker up
And then Id take two puffs
Im high now , Im high now 
Im high now , Im high now 
Lifes a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
Now
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin
30 shows a month and I still wont buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody thats holdin my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihannas accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shitll make me flip out and just kill somethin
Drill somethin, get ill and fill ratchets with a lil somethin
I practiced runnin from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make em highlight my simplest lines
Im talkin fear, fear of losin creativity
Im talkin fear, fear of missin out on you and me
Im talkin fear, fear of losin loyalty from pride
Cause my DNA wont let me involve in the light of God
Im talkin fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
Im talkin fear, fear that love aint livin here no more
Im talkin fear, fear that its wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I cant take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I cant take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin if Im livin through fear or livin through rap
Damn
God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all
Verse 2 says, You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said Hes gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
Hes gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, Hes gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so thats why we get chastised
Thats why were in the position that were in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you
Shalom
Ohhh, ohhhh, woahhh
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh
Yeah, uh
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin
Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan—
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin
Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Wont you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar?
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog?
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing
But a prophet ain’t a prophet til they ask you this question:
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Wont you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin
Let my words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that—
Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon’ stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars, hurt?
You think y’all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalized without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood, is it worth the time?
Like, who got your best interest?
Like, how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you?
And who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in?
Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn?
Revenge on your mind when it’s mentioned
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone, say;
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Wont you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga—
I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don’t let me resent you
That’s not Nelson-like—want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben’s Island analysing; that’s where his cell is
So I could find clarity—like, how much you cherish me?
Is this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy’s Law
Generation X—will I ever be your ex?
Flaws of a baby step, mauled by the mouth a bit—pause
Put me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin y’all
It’s respect—but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead?
Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter—you assassin
Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it’s Michael Jackson—oh
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us Billie Jean, you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propelling
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga, let me ask this question, nigga
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn’t wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mines
Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man
Maybe I’m just another nigga”
Shit and that’s all I wrote
I was gonna call it Another Nigga but, it ain’t really a poem
I just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to
Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you
I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-
About a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground
What you mean by that, what the ground represent?
The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
Right
That’s how I see it, my word is bond
I see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people
Right
The poor people is gonna open up this whole world
And swallow up the rich people
Cause the rich people gonna be so fat
And they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I’m saying Wealthy, appetizing
The poor gonna be so poor, and hungry
Right
You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna be like
You know what Im saying, its gonna be...
There might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-
They might eat the rich, you know what Im saying?
Aight so let me ask you this then
Do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich
Or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?
I see myself as a natural born hustler
A true hustler in every sense of the word
I took nothin’, I took the opportunities
I worked at the most menial and degrading job
And built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it
I went from having somebody managing me
To me hiring the person that works my management company
I changed everything, I realized my destiny
In a matter of five years, you know what I’m saying?
I made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people
Now it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what I’m saying?
I made millions for the record companies
I made millions for these movie companies
Now I make millions for, for us
And through your different avenues of success
How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?
By my faith in God, by my faith in the game
And by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true
Right
You know what I’m saying?
And it was happening to me for a reason
You know what I’m saying, I was noticing, shit
I was punching the right buttons and it was happening
So it’s no problem, you know
I mean, it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know
I’m finna go straight through
Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that
Somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?
Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it’s been met with resistance
And not only me but, it goes down my family tree
You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back
Aight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like
We fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win
And I wanna lay it all down
In this country, a black man only have like
5 years we can exhibit maximum strength
And that’s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong
While you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back
Cause once you turn 30 it’s like
They take the heart and soul out of a man
Out of a black man, in this country
And you don’t wanna fight no more
And if you don’t believe me, you can look around
You don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers
That’s crazy, because me being one of your offsprings
Of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that
There’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so, I wanted to ask you
What you think is the future for me and my generation today?
I think that niggas is tired of grabbin shit out the stores
And next time its a riot its gonna be like, uh, bloodshed
For real, I don’t think America know that
I think America think we was just playing
And it’s gonna be some more playing but
It ain’t gonna be no playing
It’s gonna be murder, you know what I’m saying?
It’s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker
You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen
That’s crazy, man, in my opinion
Only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations
Lot a people don’t understand how important it is, you know
Sometimes I can like, get behind a mic
And I don’t know what type of energy I’ma push out
Or where it comes from, trip me out sometimes
Because its spirits, we ain’t even really rappin’
We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
Damn
I wanted to read one last thing to you
It’s actually something a good friend had wrote
Describing my world, it says:
“The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
In order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment
The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him
But praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness
And the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life
The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city
The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon
Which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He’s trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as
Going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations
That the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
They are one and the same
What’s your perspective on that?
Pac? Pac? Pac?!
Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ayy
Who will deny that you and I and every nigga is a star?
Hit me!
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You’ll slip through the cracks hopin that you’ll survive
Gather your wit, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin of you
Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?
When I get signed, homie, Ima act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
Ima buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
Chunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin, platinum on weddin ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, Ima buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass em all out on the block, whats good?
Ima put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
At first, I did love you 
But now I just wanna fuck 
Late nights thinkin of you 
Until I get my nut 
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board 
Destroyed, but what for?
Yo, whats up? Its Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keepin it, motherfucker
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin, see, my name is Uncle Sam, Im your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind 
Dont have receipts 
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché? Then say, Fuck your haters
I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but its no white-collar in you
But its whatever though because Im still followin you
Because you make me live forever, baby
Count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much aint enough, both we know
Christmas, tell em whats on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you aint pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
Ill Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five
Yeah, lookin down, its quite a drop 
Lookin good when youre on top 
You got a medal for us
Leavin metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
Tax man comin, tax man comin
Tax man comin, tax man comin
Tax man comin, tax man comin
Tax man comin, tax man comin
Screaming
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you aint shit, feel like you dont feel
Confidence in yourself, breakin on marble floors
Watchin anonymous strangers, tellin me that Im yours
But you aint shit, Im convinced your tolerance nothin special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
Situations, Ill start with your little sister bakin
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas?
Where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of one-hunnid-thousand but never reached her
I fuckin tell you fuckin failure—you aint no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you—I dont need ya!
The world dont need ya, dont let them deceive ya
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, thats for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
Fuckin hate you, I hope you embrace it, I swear—
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Lovin you, lovin you, not lovin you, 100° proof
I can feel your vibe and recognize that youre ashamed of me
Yes, I hate you, too
Housekeeping, housekeeping
¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
¡Disculpe!
Are you the reason why mom and them leavin
No, you aint shit, you say you love em, I know you dont mean it
I know you irresponsible, selfish, in denial, cant help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend, little brother
You promised you’d watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTimed him one time, thats unforgiven
You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought hed recover well
Third surgery, they couldnt stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, You fuckin failed, you aint try
Sniffling
I know your secrets, nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga
I know depression is restin on your heart for two reasons, nigga
I know you and a couple block boys aint been speakin, nigga
Yall damn near beefin, I see it and youre the reason, nigga
And if this bottle could talk gulping
I cry myself to sleep, bitch, everything is your fault
Faults breakin to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets, dont let me tell em to the world
About that shit you thinkin and that time you gulping, Im bout to hurl
Im fucked up, but I aint as fucked up as you
You just cant get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Shouldve killed yo ass long time ago
You shouldve felt that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if these mirrors could talk itd say, You gotta go
And if I told your secrets the worldll know money cant stop a suicidal weakness
Loves gonna get you killed
But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me and—
Me, I wasnt taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasnt taught to share, but care
I care, I care
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldly possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I dont trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I dont love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I aint perfect, I probably wont come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I aint give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, youre dealing with cold thumb
I’m willing to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just cause your ass is insecure
I can’t fake humble just cause your ass is insecure
Me, I wasnt taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasnt taught to share, but care
I care, I care
Maybe I wasn’t there 
Maybe I wasnt there 
Maybe I wasnt there 
Maybe I wasnt there
Now, in a perfect world, I probably wont be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldnt blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, Ill choose faith over riches
Ill choose work over bitches, Ill make schools out of prison
Ill take all the religions and put em all in one service
Just to tell em we aint shit, but Hes been perfect, world
Me, I wasnt taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasnt taught to share, but care
I care, I care
Maybe I wasnt there 
Maybe I wasnt there 
Maybe I wasnt there 
Maybe I wasnt there
Dont tell a lie on me
I won’t tell the truth bout you
Dont tell a lie on me
I won’t tell the truth bout you
Thirty millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Travel round the atlas in this spaceship
Candy-coated, my day shifts
Been devoted to fuckin up bundles of paper
Pi equals three-fourteen
The devils pie is big enough to justify the whole thing
Wait up, lampin in Jamaica
The clouds turnin, my thoughts turnin’
Burnin’ castor oil, yo I been determined to make an earnin
This seed in this soil is classified
I’m satisfied when I strategize my kids future
I aint sanctified enough to say that I wont shoot ya
I done vandalized the industry full circuit
The earthiest slash thirstiest nigga you know versus this
Scum of a land that transcend two surfaces
The richer the poorer, the bigger the picture
The more blood pours, but—
Don’t tell a lie on me
I wont tell the truth bout you
Dont tell a lie on me
I wont tell the truth bout you
My fans cant wait for me to son ya punk-ass
And crush ya whole lil shit
Ill Big Pun ya punk-ass, you a scared lil bitch
Tiptoein around my name, nigga, you lame
And when I get at you, homie
Dont you just tell me you was just playin
Oh, I was just playin, K-Dot
Cmon, you know a nigga rock with you, bro
Shut the fuck up, you sound like the last nigga I know
Might end up like the last nigga I know
Oh, you dont wanna clash? Nigga, I know
I put my foot on the gas, head on the floor
Hoppin out before the vehicle crash, Im on a roll
Yellin, One, two, three, four, five
I am the greatest rapper alive
So damn great, motherfucker, Ive died
What you hearin now is a paranormal vibe
House on the hill, house on the beach, nigga 
A condo in Compton, Im still in reach, nigga 
Im fresh out the water, Im bout to breach, nigga
The five-foot giant woke up out of his sleep, nigga
Oh yeah, oh yeah, mo cars, mo lears
Mo bars, no peers, no scars, no fear—fuck yall, sincere
I heard the whispers, I curved the whispers
You know what the risk is
Earthed in ditches, your body revertin to stiffness
The whole world gone mad
Bodies is addin up, markets about to crash
Niggas is fake rich, bitches is fake bad
Blacks that act white, whites that do the dab
Donald Trump is a chump
Know how we feel, punk—tell him that God comin
And Russia need a replay button, yall up to somethin
Electorial votes look like memorial votes
But Americas truth aint ignorin the votes
Its blasphemy, how many gon blast for me?
I prophesized on my last song, you laughed at me
But when the shit get brackin, dont you ask for me
How many leaders gon tell you the truth after me?
G Malone, big bro, kudos to him
I was two Os from a M, tryna be big as Em
Thirty millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Salmon and capers, fame and lawsuits
You lookin at me in Chucks, Im lookin at yall suits
Me and Top Dawg playin rock-paper-scissors in court
A real hustler lose money just to go get some more
I said its like that, dropped one classic, came right back
Nother classic, right back
My next album, the whole industry on a ice pack
With TOC, you see the flames
In my E-Y-Es—its not a game
And the whole world is goin mad, daddy, its sad, daddy
My only advice? Go and get you a bag, daddy
Lee Baca on trial tryna portray a boxer
Beatin up on my niggas while the COs watch him
Tables turned, lesson learned, my best look
You jumped sides on me, now you bout to meet Westbrook
Go celebrate with your team and let victory vouch you
Just know, the next game played I might slap the shit out you
Technical foul, Im flagrant, Im foul
They throwin me out, you throw in the towel
Look at the crowd, they— 
Look at my smile, Im smirkin
Calm but urgent 
So many verses, you live in denial 
So many verses, I never run out 
You makin him nervous, the music is loud
Ho, JAY-Z Hall of Fame, sit yo punk-ass down!
So that means you aint bigger than rapping 
So that means no more playin the back scenes 
My spot is solidified if you ask me 
My name is identified as That King
Ill let yall worry about a list, Im on some other shit
A difference between accomplishments and astonishments
You know what time it is, ante up, this is in forever
Yall got til April the 7th to get yall shit together
Lets get it!
Look, look!
On foenem
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody sit yo bitch-ass down
And listen to this true mothafuckin story
Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch
Smokin on the finest dope, ay-ay-ay-ah
Drank until I cant no mo, ay-ay-ay-ah
Really Im a sober soul
But Im with the homies right now
And we aint askin for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ay-ay-ay-ah
Really, Im a peacemaker
But Im with the homies right now
And Momma used to say 
One day its gon burn you out 
One day its gon burn you out, out, out
One day its gon burn you out 
One day its gon burn you
But Im with the homies right now
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, an orange soda
Janky stash box when the federalesll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
Cause the energy we bringin sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate
If its necessary; bumpin Jeezy first album, lookin distracted
Speakin language only we know, you think its an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin like George Foreman grillin the masses
Of the workin world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin girls
And asked them what they workin with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually Im drug-free, but, shit, Im with the homies
Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga!
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my mothafuckin niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in
Me and the homies
Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka
And be like doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!”
Its 2:30 and the sun is beamin
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin
Hungry for anything unhealthy
And if nutrition can help me
Ill tell you to suck my dick, then Ill continue eatin
We speedin on the 405, passin Westchester
You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses
Good Lord, they knew we werent from round there
Cause every time we down there
We pullin out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didnt like
Then started interrogatin
I never was a gangbanger, I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
Thats ironic, cause Ive never been violent
Until Im with the homies
Me and the homies
Me and the homies
Me and the homies
Braggin bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didnt make me feel that bad
Im usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we aint got the CD in
But Jeezy still playin
And our attitude is still nigga, what is you sayin?
Pull in front of the house
That we been campin out for like two months
The sun is goin down as we take whatever we want
Ayy, ayy, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe!
Ayy, nigga, I think theres somebody in this room!
Wait, what?!
Nigga, theres somebody in this room!
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVDs, plasma-screen TVs in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circlin life
My mama called: Hello? What you doin? — Kickin it.
I shoulda told her Im probably bout to catch my first offense
With the homies
But – they made a right, then made a left
Then made a right, then another right
One lucky night with the homies
K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded
I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well, which one he talkin about?
I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he aint hit that
Nah, that nigga straight, he aint hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!
Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga— whats that Jeezy song say, nigga?
Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!
Yeah, yeah, that shit right there

There he go. Man, you dont even know how the shit go
Look, heres the plan, luv
We gon use the kickback as a alibi, wait til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
Thats what hes not gon do
Then we all gon meet back at the block at about 10:30
Thats straight, but we should meet up around 12
Im tryna fuck on somethin too

1K
It was always me versus the world
Until I found its me versus me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!
We gon put it in reverse
Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—
Oh, Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, Im a star
Life is one funny mafucker
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin, infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest povertys dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin and jokin made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
A four-year-old tellin his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin and bangin
He was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin
Fifteen, scrapin up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
Ten-thousand dollars out of a project housing, thats on the daily
Seen his first mill twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case
Fingerprints on the gun they assumin, but witnesses couldnt prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin
Bird-shufflin, Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing They say 5-0 came, circlin parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin out while harrassin the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window
His name was Ducky, he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars
They had a son, hopin that hed see college
Hustlin on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, hed ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in 84
Thats when affiliation was really at gears of war
So many relatives tellin us, sellin us devilish works, killin us, crime
Intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9s
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured hed get on these niggas good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
Anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didnt kill him
In fact, it look like theyre the last to survive, pay attention
That one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and Ill tell you why
You take two strangers and put em in random predicaments
Give em a soul, so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin their benefits
Then you start remindin them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

So, I was takin a walk the other day…
Alright, here we go, third take
Real quick, Ali
Mmm
Got me breathing with dragons
Ill crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
Im Marilyn Manson with madness
Now just imagine the magic I light to asses
Dont ask for your favorite rapper
, yes, sir , church
, I killed him , bitch
And this is rigor mortis and its gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and Im Morpheus, the matrix of my mind
Im out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
Im on the toilet when I rhyme, if you the shit, then I decline
I climax where you begin and then I end on cloud nine
And thats important when you morph into an angel in the sky
And dont be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply
And tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And Ima be here for a while, just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you can fight, we always making em duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI just might investigate this fucking parasite
Thats what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony
Ferragami so many and cool enough for the 70s
Nigga, paybacks a bitch, and bitch, you been livin in debt with me
Dead em all and especially
Leave a call on his mother voicemail that say that he rest in peace
Bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling? Thats irrelevant, rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody, couldnt think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q, its just me, Jay Rock, Soul, and Q
Solar system and barbecue, nothing else you can do
, yup-yup , I killed him
, amen
Got me breathing with dragons
Ill crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
Im Marilyn Manson, dont ask for your favorite rapper
, yup-yup , I know
, for sure , amen
Got me breathing with dragons
Ill crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
Im Marilyn Manson, dont ask for your favorite rapper
I wrapped him and made him Casper, I capture the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya, Ill pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, wont you send us to Bible study faster?
Your hypocritist reaction a blasphemy, I assassin my casualty
And its casually done, and tell em my salary come
In lump sum one hundreds, dont talk to me bout no money
The sun is under my feet, and I come in peace to compete
I dont run if youd rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek, and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody deceased
Some persistence, recognize I be
Really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition breaking up the street
Better partition, better dot your T
And I gon mention how the far you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitching, getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick in the battery
And Im charged up, and the catastrophe
Is charged up, and the audacity
Of yall fucks never could hassle me
And yall luck just ran out, youll see
, yup-yup , I know
, for sure , amen
Got me breathing with dragons
Ill crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
Im Marilyn Manson, dont ask for your favorite rapper
, yup-yup , I know
, for sure , amen
How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, yall
Gotta see how I’m chillin once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
20 on pump 6, dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
Twenty years ago, cant forget
Now I can lend him a ear or two
How to stack these residuals tenfold
The liberal concept of what menll do
20 on 6, he didnt hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was leery
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for ten Rand, stressin about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didnt believe it
Told him, Beat it
Contributin money just for his pipe—I couldnt see it
He said, My son, temptation is one thing that Ive defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin less, nothin more
I told him I aint have it and closed my door
Tell me, how much a dollar cost?
Its more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe
Hes starin at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin, hes starin at me, I grab my key
Hes starin at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger
Like I was supposed to save him
Like Im the reason hes homeless and askin me for a favor
Hes starin at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
Hes starin at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
Cause now Im starin back at him, feelin some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, itd be aimin at his neck
I never understood someone beggin for goods
Askin for handouts, takin it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin at me for the longest until he finally asked
Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need
Tell me, how much a dollar cost?
Its more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe
Guilt trippin and feelin resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin
Sour emotions got me lookin at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck Im kiddin?
So Ima tell you like I told the last bum
Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines
And I recognize this type of panhandlin all the time
I got better judgment, I know when niggas hustlin, keep in mind
When I was strugglin, I did compromise, now I comprehend
I smell Grandpas old medicine, reekin from your skin
Moonshine and gin, nigga youre babblin, your words aint flatterin
Im imaginin Denzel but lookin at ONeal
Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin focus
And Im insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, Your potential is bittersweet
I looked at him and said, Every nickel is mines to keep
He looked at me and said, Know the truth, itll set you free
Youre lookin at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit
The nerve of Nazareth, and Ill tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss—I am God
I washed my hands, I said my grace
What more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess Im not all what its all meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change to right my wrongs
Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
Section.80, HiiiPoWeR
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
Im falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengetis clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss, but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
Unless you eatin pussy that smell like its a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfuckin pistol
Aimin it at a pig, Charlottes web is gonna miss you
My issue isnt televised and you aint gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat, because our lifes an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I wont sugarcoat it
Youd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I dont want a plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian
While you motherfuckers waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean this shit is
Huey Newton going stupid, you cant resist his
HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
Sorry, mama, I cant turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fuckin widows peak, uh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uh
Them demons got me, I aint prayed in some weeks, uh
Dear Lord, come save me, the devils working hard
He probably clockin double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightenin, so fuckin frightenin
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill
Im standing on a field full of land mines
Doin the moonwalk, hopin I blow up in time
Cause 2012 might not be a fuckin legend
Tryna be a fuckin legend, the man of mankind
Who said a Black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean this shit is
Bobby Seale makin meals, you cant resist his
HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR
Every day, we fight the system just to make our way
We been down for too long, but thats alright
We was built to be strong, cause its our life, na-na-na
Every day, we fight the system, we fight the system
We fight the system 
We been down for too long, but thats alright, na-na-na
Who said a Black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked, we was racin with Marcus Garvey
On the freeway to Africa til I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once Im on that pedestal
Frightenin, so fuckin frightenin
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill dont sing, or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said bang
The drama it bring is crazy, product of the late 80s
Tryna stay above water, thats why we shun the Navy
Pull your guns and play me, lets set it off
Cause a riot, throw a Molotov
Somebody told me them pirates had got lost
Cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Yeah, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean this shit is
Fred Hampton on your campus, you cant resist his
HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR
Thug life
Thug life
Ayy, in my apartment a long time ago
I knew a bad bitch, but she was kinda slow
Still gave it up when its a few of us
She let me finger-fuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train
She wanted to hang with us, we wanted one thang
Just penetratin that throat, dawg
She choked on it like smoke, dawg
But whenever I fucked up my re-up
In a dice game I go see her
Shell give me enough to buy a quarter ounce
And then blow a blunt of that reefer
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers
Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can page to put a 69
And I know it time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
Why you always give your ass up?
I mean, damn, these hoes get paid
All you do is get laid—this shit dont add up.
She said, Tip, all I wanna do is feel love
Even if I know it aint real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it
And then never call back, I still fuck.
And thats fucked up, but she so trill
I need somethin, she go steal
When the trap hot and police ride
Nigga, guess where we go chill?
For bout four years she held dope
And my four pounds til it go down
I remember shawty, she stayed down
I wont say her name ‘cause she married now
When the lights go out
And Im in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When Im in my bed
I think of all the memories Ive had
All of the things I did back then
She would always turn heads when shed fall through
She would always make moves how a boss do
And she never gave any nigga time of day
But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to
But when it came to me, she had a thing for me
When we kicked it she roll up the weed for me
And wed both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watchin just to see if the police comin
We got close over time, her and I
Right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was bout 17
I aint even have a license, couldnt even drive
I was goin back and forth with each flight
Another show after show, each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
Shed go through my phone and wed fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasnt really much more that we could do
Wasnt really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few
Huh, one night I had a few
Yeah, this little chick that caught my eye
I told her: Hurry up, meet me at the room!
And no, I didnt have a contraceptive
What my common sense neglected
And two months later, next thing I know
I got a text that said Im pregnant
And you can almost bet she kept it
And thats the reason why you left me
On top of all that, it wasnt even mine
I went and got paternity tested—damn!
When the lights go out
And Im in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When Im in my bed
I think of all the memories Ive had
All of the things I did back then
Wait, hol up, is that you?
With them big ol thighs after school?
Jay 305 had gave me high five
When I said I’m in hot pursuit
You said I won’t ride until Kendrick drive
A new Monte Carlo that cruise
And that shot my pride, I tried to improv
But no freestyle I never do
You lookin for the nigga with the tallest fetti
You overlookin every nigga that ain’t quite ready
To make it rain on you like Im about to break a levee
Hol up, that pussy petty
Yeah, your nails did, your hair did
Your cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a Hummer
Her new prima donna I smelt it
Tried to make you mine, ho!
Tried to make some time, ho!
But I ain’t got the time or the patience
To stop and wait in line, ho!
Her dreams holds Versace
She fall for Armani
Only deal with rich niggas—fuck you and Mick Romney!
I’m grown now, I’m on my own now
I’m po-o-o-oppin
Change my phone now when I get home now
I got o-o-o-options
Fast forward, wait, is that you?
With them big ol thighs after school?
And your three kids and three baby daddies
Same car note that’s overdue? I know
When the lights go out
And Im in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When Im in my bed
I think of all the memories Ive had
All of the things I did back then
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk-
Sex
She just want to close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you 
Exercise her right to work it out
Its true, its true, its true
Shout out to the birthday girls
Say hey , say hey , 
Everyone deserves a night to play 
She plays, only when you tell her no
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me, I’m just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, its still amazing, before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
I’m not involved, I’d rather diss em
I’d rather call on you, put your wall up
Cause when I come around, demolition gon’ crush
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it
If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say youre irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me
Retaliation is strong, you even dream bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin on a famous rapper
Walls can talk 
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
Dick hard like rottweiler
Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Woo woo, woo woo
The whole industry been in shambles
Everybody fugazi, I’m just changing the channel
Kendrick Lamar, the people’s champion, Im animal for analysts
Career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
I like my raps extra prolific
Since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
And I won’t mention my 10,000 hours in training
While juggling, gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous
And now we look at the competition as quick submission
They tappin’ out before we even get a chance to miss ‘em
What this about, is it money or skill?
Maybe it’s both and I got large amounts of it, it’s real
You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
I can see y’all incapable
To be the God emcees, you know me well
Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
Run for cover, my lineage prove itself
I’m rollin’ deep in that paper like two Adeles
Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips
We here to shake the game up and youre flying through turbulence
Everything is high stakes nowadays, that’s how it played nowadays
It’s like an 8-ball to the face nowadays
Im laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays
It’s seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, Im talking
Higher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer
Since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion
Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!
This is what they want, I’m the one
This is vintage from 1980 somethin
I’m the son of the pioneer that got you near the sun
Play with him, bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump
I’m yelling Mr. Kanye West for president
He probably let me get some head inside the residence
I’m in the White House going all out
Bumping College Dropout, God bless Americans
Nothing more influential than rap music
I merge jazz fusion with the trap music
I mix black soul with some rock and roll
They never box me in, I’m David Blaine-ing all you hoes
Oh yea, let’s go there, my DNA is DMT, I’m so rare
My Juvenile was wilder than the Nolia
A locomotive couldn’t track me down in my career
Runnin’ this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, I might demolish
A bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here?
D-Bo, all of it one year, Mississippi to California
It gets annoying, niggas wanna deplore him
And bitches wanna adore him, but industry shit ain’t for him
Probably thinking it’s for him, only one me
Swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign
Mr. Valevictorian studied the game before them
Listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them
To the grave I deport them, corporations extort them
I’m snapping off my endorphins, I alien mighty morphin’
My radiance rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman
Hundred mil in my fortune, they call me back in the morning
Youre racing against the tortoise, pace myself it’s important
Lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous
So pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments
Jimi Kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted 
I tell a bitch don’t sweat me 
I kill this whole fuckin’ beat if Cole let me 
Ib should’ve never sent the instrumental
Every time I start writing I get sentimental
This shit is just not fair
But why the fuck should I care?
The story of your life here
Two young stars was born and y’all gon’ die here
Oh Lord, gotta be the yams
Billboard list need 2Pac, damn
But number 9 makes sure he lives on, yeah
Hoochie, coochie, pussies in a trance
Every day a celebration, but even the valley peaking me
Is not validation, nigga this TDE
And my doggies be salivating, salaries, better ratings
And casualties all around me, don’t make me do demonstrations
Whoa
Murder my allegations and burning my finger traces
Adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments
I’m sorry y’all not relating, this party is reservated
I kill this whole muthafucking beat if J. Cole say it
My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental, I gotta slay it
I gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers I’m not to play with
The ruckus had been my favorite, King Kunta the fuckin’ greatest
Whoa
Burnin’ my leather-
Motherfuckers talkin crazy 
Sayin’ I should quit 
I fuckin tell em make me 
Eat a fuckin’ dick 
Im feelin like the greatest 
On the beat who ever did it
Mike WiLL the one who made it
Its Shady on the lyrics
Im somewhat outlandish they say
You say were cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin
At anything that may stand in they way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, Im a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my CAT scan that day 
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray
I’m turnin’ back to a madman, cant take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basal ganglia’s an A to the K
Get your ass sprayed like bidets
Breakin your legs eight different ways, ankle to waist
You chumps dont even know how to do somethin
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin’ you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
Or you had them choked up, youd be yankin my chain 
Feelin like Im headed for the padded cell, the
Bar for me when I rap isnt fair but
Guess thats the standard Im held to
But if somethin like that doesnt tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are looked at as a failure 
Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper
Cause, damn it, Im still the
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But Im the greatest
So you sold ten million albums, eh? 
Only problem is, you put out ten million albums, eh? 
What was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know theres people that are pissed about the way
I mispronounced a name, DIE ANTWOORD!
Fuck, I still cant say this shit, but how quickly they forget
Who the fuck I was; now Ninja try to duck my slugs
You let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
Id like to give a shout to Cypress 
This cant be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin to
Give you a shout—now get the fuck out my rhyme book
No more shiners, already too much time took
And rappers I hear you talkin shit
Im just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it
Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit
You dont got the tools I got in my toolkit 
I bullshit you not, yall fools just forgot
That Im so fuckin awful with the thoughts
And when Im hostile and impossible to stop
So you can call it a nostril cause its not gonna ever
Ill never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop
Cause Im wipin up everyone in this genre
Cause on the mic I feel like Im the
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But Im the greatest
Oh yeah, and one more thing I want to mention 
Is youre one dimension
Im a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
And I love contentions, so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin, gotta strut like a front suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine 
Psychopath, Michael Jacks blowin up like a raft
I should slap Vlad with a ISIS flag
Bet you I come back twice as bad 
Revival didnt go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that, Im finna hit back
Til I run out of gunpowder and split the scene
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips are the clips, got the sig lit like its nicotine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean 
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
Thats why I call the motherfuckers M16s 
Float like a butterfly, Im gonna sting like a bee
You aint harmin a thing
I hit a ding hard as Im gonna swing
Im gonna need to put my arm in a sling
But like a wedding band
You gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
Anomaly, Im Muhammad Ali
Cause I knew one day Im gonna be the
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But Im the greatest
Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, yeah, like
I ran out of tears when I was eighteen
So nobody made me but the main streets
Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me, then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like Im chosen
And if you aint my nigga, then your girl single to me
I dont give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever son me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldnt touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when Im never makin money, ah
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street niggas eyes
Every time you see me pullin up in Aventadors
Just know we been grindin on them sidewalks
Sidewalks saved my life
They dont ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They show me all the signs
They dont let me down

And they dont let me down
But they lead me on

Say, say, say
Trippin off Dyke and my name strike with pay day
Say, say, say
Flippin blue lightnin, tightenin, strapped with AK
Say, say, say
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Aw, Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line em up, we grind em up, theres nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head 
Head, head, more head 
Oh God, bless the dead 
Im livin life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
Im the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it aint one
Break everything, Im a hustler, came from
Sidewalks saved my life 
They dont ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life 
They show me all the signs
They dont let me down

So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
Fuck what they talkin bout, your shit is where its at, my nigga
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game, your hood, your name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin to the scripts, now, here, if them Benjamins go cuddle up
Skip, hop, drip, drop
Flip, flop with the white tube sock
It goes, Sherm sticks, burn this
Thats what the product smell like when the chemicals mix
50-nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings, and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you

On the dead homies
Hopped out the Caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called and said, The enemies done cliqued up
Oh, yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everything is everything, its scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin, scramblin, football numbers slanderin
Niggas names on paper—you snitched all summer
Streets don’t fail me now
They tell me its a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress
Set-trippin’ all around
Aint nothin new but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-icans
Red state versus a blue state—which one you governin?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom, they fuck with you, Obama say, What it do?
Obama say, What it do?
Obama say, What it do?
Obama say, What it do?
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo

Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who Black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin
Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Miked be platinum
Y’all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don’t ask about no camera blocking at award shows
No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my Vogues
Less you askin me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
Im the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box”
I box ‘em all in, by a landslide
Nah, homie, we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the Coast involved, then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said, Its funny how one verse could fuck up the game
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didnt want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didnt stop survivors guilt
Going back and forth
Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war
Back in the city
I was entering a new one
Aint nobody prayin for me
Aint nobody prayin for me
Aint nobody prayin for me
I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like Im losin my focus
I feel like Im losin my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like youre miseducated
Feel like I dont wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it aint no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin, Im done pretendin
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin
I feel like the feelings are changin
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I aint feelin you all
Feel like removin myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, Ive been in the field for you
Its real for you, right? Shit, I feel like—
Aint nobody prayin for me
Aint nobody prayin for me
Aint nobody prayin for me
Aint nobody prayin
I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin they pockets
I feel like debatin on who the greatest can stop it
I am legend, I feel like all of yall is peasants
I feel like all of yall is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin a real mic
I aint feelin your presence
Feel like Ima learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin aint mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin of no hope
The feelin of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin, the feelin of false freedom
Ill force-feed em the poison that fill em up in the prison
I feel like its just me
Look, I feel like I cant breathe
Look, I feel like I cant sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin of fallin, of fallin apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin the void of bein employed with ballin
Streets is talkin, fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin where Pac was
The feelin of an apocalypse happenin
But nothin is awkward, the feelin wont prosper
The feelin is toxic, I feel like Im boxin demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
I feel like sayin somethin, I feel like takin somethin
I feel like skatin off, I feel like waitin for em
Maybe its too late for em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for em
But who the fuck prayin for me?
Aint nobody prayin for me
Who prayin for me?
Aint nobody prayin
Lord God, I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that You raised him from the dead
I would ask that Jesus come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus name, amen
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an 04 Mercedes-Benz
Hello, my name is Kendrick, she said, No, youre handsome
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin shades now, cool
Where you stay? She said, Down the street from Dominguez High
Okay, I know thats borderline Compton or Paramount
Well, is it Compton? No, she replied
Then quickly start battin her eyes
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen with nothin but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful, What you tryna get into?
She didnt tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and, well
The summer had passed, and now Im likin her
Conversation we havin probably enticin her
Who can imagine? Maybe my actionsll end up wifin her
Love or lust, regardless, well fuck cause the trife in us
Its deep-rooted, the music of bein young and dumb
Is never muted, in fact, its much louder where Im from
We know a lot bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius is irrepetible
Family history of gangbangin did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin a nut
I wanna come over, whats up?
Thats what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, Im tryna get off
I was in heat like a cactus
My tactics of bein thirsty probably could hurt me
But fuck it, I got some heart
Grabbed my mama keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy
So now Im down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope, cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
Im thinkin bout that sex
Thinkin bout her thighs or maybe kissin on her neck or maybe what positions next
Sent a picture of her titties, blowin up my texts
I looked at em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, shes a masseuse
And Im a professional pornstar when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
Im hopin to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem
Im two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin me cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang
Please leave your message for three-two-three
Record your message after the tone
Kendrick, where you at?
Damn, Im sittin here waitin on my van
You told me you was gon be back in fifteen minutes

I wake in the morning, my head spinning from the last night
Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Did this before, promised myself Id be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap then do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Looking for confirmation, hoping election wasnt true
All of us worried, all of us buried, in our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor bout it—
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passing, things change
Reverting back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust
Lately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately Lately, my lust been heightened 
Lately, its all contradiction 
Lately, I lust over self 
Lately, in James 4:4 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself: Lust is all yours
I need some water
Something came over me
Way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat
Too close to comfort

Ooh, I dont want more than that; girl, I respect the cat
I promise, just a touch

If its okay; she said, Its okay
Somethings burnin, I cant figure out what 
Its either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded; must
Just be the powder from the power of 
But Im in something I dont know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon-to-be-spouse’s moan?
And the further I walk, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain thats what I heard
‘Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt, I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her
The thoughts scary, yo, though and it hurts—brace!
Hope it aint, Here we go, yo!
‘Cause my head already goes to worst-case
Scenario, though in the first place 
But you confirmed my low-end theory though
Shouldve known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Couldve made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
No, you dont under— —stand, 
I dont do this for anyone, ever 
Yeah, that aint what they all say?
Ill say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiancé
Til you sucked on Wayne, André, and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow da Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwamé
Guess Im gettin my g-goddang Jigga on, eh?
‘Cause your name, Im beyond sayin
But fuck it, Im movin on, you women are all cray
But Ill probably always keep on playin the—
Game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love
She doesnt love me, no, she dont love me no more
She hates my company, guess she dont love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her, Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I dont care!
And I told her, Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I dont care!
I told that bitch, Im a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick
Suckin dick in your mama tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned, like an abortion
They booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
Sherane is not available now, leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, dont forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fuckin Ferris wheel
Fuckin spinnin on me—fuck you think, we gon get married still?
Fuckin Mary had a little lamb, this aint no fairy tale
Fairy godmama better tell you how I fuckin feel
Like you should fuckin beat it
Or fuckin eat it while Im on my period
Now have a blessed day! Bitch, you serious?
Im in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you aint fuckin with me, you cut me deep as Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, Im delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
Thats analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin cordial, yeah, I got some home training
That aint what you like, aint it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singin, I hope shes good enough
Meanwhile youre chasin her
Chlamydia couldnt even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, Ima live with the—
Game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her, Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I dont care!
And I told her, Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I dont care!
So needless to say Im feelin betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wires dick
Now shes chasin me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record cliché
Its all my fault anyway, shes turnin the tables, Im a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together, but forgot today was her B-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding, but just as I went to slam on the brakes
Thats when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin seventy-three, thank God theres an exit comin up
What the mother-F-U-C-Ks wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp til I coasted to a goshdamn halt
Hit a fuckin tree, now here she comes at full speed
Shes racin at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch that bitch out her car through the window
She screamin, I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried the stink ho in it, then paid to have the street repaved
 Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, ‘cause shes layin next to me in bed—directly aimin a gat at my head!
Woke up again and jumped up
Like, Fuck it! Ive had it, Im checkin into rehab
I confess Im a static addict, I guess thats why Im so clingy
Every girl Ive ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or Im too fuckin dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? Im just a fuckin romantic
I fuckin love you, you fuckin bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, Hit the road, then after she left
I sent that bitch a text that said, Be careful driving
Dont read this and have an accident
She glanced to look at it and wrecked 
Too bad, thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in LOréal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytellin
While the whore was yellin, Rape!
Til her vocal cords were swellin
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings face
Still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
Less youre Andrea Yates, dont ask me for a date though
Youre late, well, the sentiments great
But wait, think theres been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
Its mainly cause of the game of— 
Wait, dinner at eight? I have infinite hate in my blood
Its mainly cause of the—
Game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip 
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip
Lil sip, took a lil sip
Took a lil sip, t-took a lil, took a lil, took a lil sip
Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold techs like they mad at the ref
Thats why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adams apple
Slick with words dont hate me, son
What you eat dont make me shit and who you fuck dont make me cum
Put a price on my head wont make me run
Try to kill me but it cant be done
Cause my words gon live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip 
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip
Bitches come and go 
Money come and go 
Love come and go 
Bitches come and go 
Money come and go 
Love come and go 
Take a seat baby girl youve been all in my mind

Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy aint shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And thats why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
Cause a nigga poppin like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making As at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon tell
Fuck her while her mama home, baby, dont yell
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader, fuck your magazine hater
When I say that Im the greatest I aint talking about later
Ima drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wanyá
And I dont mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this whats next, the boy sick, cant disinfect
Lifes a bitch and her pussys wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death
Blaow
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip 
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip
Bitches come and go 
Money come and go 
Love come and go 
Bitches come and go 
Money come and go 
Love come and go 
Dont shit last, dont shit last and you know that

World in my palms, ironically
I am the Globetrotters best cause I didnt drop the ball
Told niggas when I was 16

In the paddy wagon with six teens
Should have been in the pen

Empty out another magazine like blah
Let a young nigga get by 
I kill em all when they try to kill my vibe 
I am the bad, the good god, the last the hood got
The last that would try to pass a good job
If Shawns a black Beatle then I need a 10 second drum solo

What the fuck is really going on?
This dick aint free
You lookin at me like it aint a receipt
Like I never made ends meet
Eating your leftovers and raw meat
This dick aint free
Livin in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin me green is all I need
Evidently, all I seen was Spam and raw sardines
This dick aint free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four-inch rims
Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents?
Hell fuckin naw, this dick aint free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pitbull
Bullshit, matador, matador
Had the door knockin, let em in, whos that?
Genitals best friend, this dick aint free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
Kept me up watchin pornos in poverty; apology? No
Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has its day, now doggy style shall help
This dick aint free
Matter of fact, it need interest
Matter of fact, its nine inches
Matter of fact, see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, youre pinchin my percents
Its been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck its more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think is in more shit?
Porcelain pipes pressure, bust em twice
Choice is devastated, decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I picked cotton and made you rich
Now my dick aint free
Ima get my Uncle Sam to fuck you up
You aint no king
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Im always ready for a war again
Go down that road again

Im always ready to take a life again
You know Ill ride again
Its all the same 
Tell me whos gon save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me whos gon save me from this hell
Without you, Im all alone
Who gon pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
Cause Im alone, you see
If Im gon die for you
If Im gon kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey
I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
Im tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid aint relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? 
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? 
My heart dont skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption
The souls of sufferin men
Clutchin on deaf ears again, rapture is comin
Its all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good
Then thats what it gotta be
Who gon pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
Cause Im alone, you see
If Im gon die for you
If Im gon kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Who gon pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
Cause Im alone, you see
If Im gon die for you
If Im gon kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey
Just in case my faith go, Ill live by my own law
Ill live by my own law, Ill live by my own
Just in case my faith go, Ill live by my own law
Ill live by my own law, Ill live by my own
What money got to do with it
When I dont know the full definition of a rap image?
Im trapped inside the ghetto and I aint proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin back for a visit, hol up
Get it back
I said Im trapped inside the ghetto and I aint proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?
If I was the president
Id pay my mamas rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Whoever thought?
Master, take the chains off me!
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, shit
Life, to me, like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin for somethin, thats the obvious
Oh shit, flows so sick, dont you swallow it
Bitin my style, youre salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work dont follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
Ill tell you my hypothesis, Im probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think Im a god
Truthfully all of em spoiled, usually, youre never charged
But somethin came over you once I took you to them fuckin BET Awards
You lookin at artistses like theyre harvestses
So many Rollies around you and you want all of em
Somebody told me you thinkin bout snatchin jewelry
I shouldve listened when my grandmama said to me:
Shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass, nigga
Shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass, boy
Shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot somethin, God bless the kid
Took his homies to the show and this is what they said:
Fuck am I posed to do when Im lookin at walkin licks?
The constant big money talk bout the mansion and foreign whips
The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, givin up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin dick, fuck is this?
One more sucker wavin with a flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him
Quickly because he got it
Its a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
No more livin poor, meet my four-four
When I see em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know theyre your co-workers
But its gon take a lot fore this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see Im on the clock once that watch landin in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin it back to the poor?
Well, thats me at these awards
I guess my grandmama was warnin a boy
She said
Shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass, nigga
Shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass, boy
Shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood
But you cant take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywoods nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service
This what God feel like, huh, he-yeah
Laughin to the bank like, A-ha!, huh, he-yeah
Flex on swole like, A-ha!, huh, he-yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, he-yeah 
Ever since a young man 
All I wanna be was a gunman 
Shootin’ up the charts, better run, man
Yall gotta see that I won, man
Slick as El DeBarge with the finger waves, work it, JT
Handle bars like a fade, watch me work it, JT
Im at large, runnin’ plays like a circuit, JT
Im sellin verses, JT, watch me work it, JT
Look, look… hol up!
Dont judge me! My mama caught me with a strap
Dont judge me! I was young, fuckin all the brats
Dont judge me! Aimin’ at your head for a stack
Don’t judge! Dont judge me! Now my home got a Valley peak
Don’t judge me! If I press your line you a freak
Dont judge me! Wont you tell a friend? Yall gon’ see—
This what God feel like, huh, he-yeah
Laughin to the bank like, A-ha!, huh, he-yeah
Flex on swole like, A-ha!, huh, he-yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, he-yeah 
Fuck is you talkin to?
Ayy, do you know who you talkin to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill em with kindness
Or I kill em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get yo ass killed by the finest
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothin in life I cant handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cause, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace yall
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel
I dont rush shit, fuck shit, always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit, morning to the night shift
Im on, I aint sorry for it
Asked for a piece of mind, you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
Im in the streets sometimes and cant afford it
I got a bad habit, levitatin, duckin haters
Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous
This what God feel like
Huh, he-yeah 
Laughin to the bank like, A-ha!
Huh, he-yeah 
Flex on swole like, A-ha!
Huh, he-yeah 
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, he-yeah 
This what God feel like
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know Im there
With my hands in the air, Im proud to say yeah
Im real, Im real, Im really, really, real
Im real, Im real, Im really, really, real
Im real, Im real, Im really, really, real
Im real, Im real, Im really, really, real
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill
Youre living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red bottom and gold that say Queen
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love French tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you dont love yourself?
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know Im there
With my hands in the air, Im proud to say yeah
Im real, Im real, Im really, really, real
Im real, Im real, Im really, really, real
Im real, Im real, Im really, really, real
Im real, Im real, 
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics turn stale
Where they mold thats green, I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A only can make another mistake
And you cant see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks, youll still say youre lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women, you love keepin control
Of everything that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love running, ducking police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you dont love yourself?
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know Im there
With my hands in the air, Im proud to say yeah
Im real, Im real, Im really, really, real
Im real, Im real, Im really, really, real
Im real, Im real, Im really, really, real
Im real, Im real 
The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes, cant you tell?
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A dont come free
And plan C just an excuse like because
Or the word but, but what if I got love?
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse ’cause youre the girl I attract
I love second verse ’cause youre the homie that pack
Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much, I dont love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I dont love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love?
Should I hate living my life inside the club?
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason?
Should I hate him for telling me that Im seizin?
Should I hate them for telling me ball out?
Should I hate street credibility Im talkin about
Hating all money, power, respect in my will
Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?
Kenny, I aint trippin off them dominoes anymore. Just calling, sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy, but dont learn the hard way like I did, homie. Any nigga can kill a man, that dont make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family. Real is God, nigga
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know Im there
With my hands in the air, Im proud to say yeah
Im real, Im real, Im really, really, real
Im real, Im real, Im really, really, real
Im real, Im real, Im really, really, real
Im real, Im real 
Alright, thats all I wanted to tell you. Just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom
Boy, you better have my car on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I aint trippin. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by Food for Less and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now thats what yall need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take that music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit, you know we from Chicago, you know thats what we do
Sing my song, its all for you
Sing my song, its all for you
Sing my song, its all for you
Sing my song, its all for you
Sing my song, its all for you
Sing my song, its all for you

Sing my song, its all for you
If I dont hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement, and thats the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I dont hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? Talk to you later, bye.
Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?
So I was takin a walk the other day
And I seen a woman—a blind woman
Pacin up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin and
Havin a hard time findin it
So after watchin her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
Hello, maam, can I be of any assistance?
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it
She replied, Oh, yes, you have lost something
Youve lost… your life
{Gunshot}
Is it wickedness?
Lamar stated his views on police brutality
With that line in the song, quote
And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo sho
Oh, please, ugh, I dont like it
If you miss me
And you cant find
Me nowhere
I done seen it all, oh my God
Uh
I done seen it all, oh my God, I swear
Uh, uh

She digging me and I’m cuffing her friend
She ig-ing you while we fucking for fun
I got her suckin her thumb, that’s my lil baby
She call me daddy like grandmama baby

When they should keep eye on they bitch ’cause baby girl coming with son
Niggas be judging my moves, but please tell me, what have you done?
My cousin might air out the party for fun
Pistol grips get to squeezing
Wish a nigga would like Liam Neeson
I don’t even need a reason, loyalty over treason
Bitch nigga, come and see me
Put some respect on my name
What side of my city I claim
I try to stay in my lane
Took my advance and put a Caprice on them thangs

Hey, whats up doc?
Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I-I wonder whats that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove
You told me, Dont be like me, just finish watching cartoons
Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room
And I run it 
And I run it 
And I run it 
And I run it 
Thats ironic 
Ironic 
Thats ironic 
Ironic 
Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth
Just for you, mothafucka, hope yall amused
And I run it 
And I run it 
And I run it 
And I run it 
Thats ironic
Liberation… Leader…
Popular pie plant pictured here…
Wile E. Coyote! Wile E. Coyote!
This shit make a nigga just wanna write
Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
Apple Jacks and after that I hit the TV Guide
Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
I’m a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
Tell a story that Ill never grow to 25
Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
And thats a covenant I put on every tribe
Aint nobody gon tie your shoe
Nobody gon abide by your rule
Nobody holding your gun
How come your tongue say, killa then kill my mood
Light speed living in the world you know
Little old me, feeling like a live wire
Bet I put some new tires on a lightning bolt
Til I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote
Im from the bottom of the jungle
Living in the bottom of the food chain
When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
A new name, want stripes, and you a zebra look-alike
Hope another homicide dont numb you a nun do
Things we will never learn soon
In the era where we wanna earn soon
Thats a error, you can smell it in the air
And everybody really doomed
Thats why Im backdooring you motherfuckas
All yall can suck my dick
All them days at the county building
Im bout to make my mama rich
Cartoons and I aint felt this 
Scrooge McDuck , elementary hood shit
Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I wonder whats that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove
You told me, Dont be like me, just finish watching cartoons

Just for you, mothafucka, hope yall amused
And I run it 
And I run it 
And I run it 
And I run it 
Thats ironic
This shit make a nigga just wanna shit on everybody
Even with a pot to piss in
Ima aim sloppy at a loud mouth, discharge
Dismiss any business of yours
Discounts never did amount to a check
That ya ass couldnt cash when the shit bounce
Everything dismounts, niggas gon flip that car
AKs for the whole hood
House lick went down perfect
Two shots to the head he deserved it
I overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
Dark Wing Duck lost service
Mama said Id better duck, shes nervous
Drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
I mean dont intervene with no gun machine
This block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin
Emerging on everbody corner 
Get a toe tag when you play tag
With a task of a new 
Everybody wanna know my life
How did I make it 
Well let me tell you like this
Ive been running this shit since I 
Cartoons and cereal
Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I wonder whats that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove

Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room
And I run it
Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth, just for you
Muhfucka, hope yall amused!
I did wrong, karma came
Crackers gave me ball and chain
Friends, enemies all the same
State, fed, both can hang
Nobody cant mute me
But I never said nobody cant shoot me
Just another stat to the white folks
Still whip work to the white yolk, absolutely!
Everyday feel like the one before
Hunt the money, dont hunt the ho
If you do what you always done
Then you get what you always got
You dumb buffoons!
I aint seen the back of my eyelids
For about the past 72 hours
Hand on my heart, face to the hood
I pledge every word you ever heard was honest
Yeah, this me, no mic
No cameras, no lights, just pain
Mama, how much trauma can I sustain?
Dirty money come with lots of stains
Road to riches come with lots of lanes
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit, got lots to gain…
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit, got lots to gain
What is life for a nigga like me?
Living out his backpack every night
Needed a new place to sleep
But this is now, nigga
Ones for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready cause I feel I finally did it
Fours for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
Turn that mothafucka to a critic
Man, I got so much shit up on my plate, dog
I was hanging on them corners late
Pockets wasnt straight, bitch
I aint gon make it at this rate, dog, know what Im saying?
Nigga praying up to God just hoping that he hear a nigga
I know the world got more problems and its much bigger
But I figured, Id get some shit up off my chest
To all my niggas I would die for, load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas thatll never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep goin hard, dont let em see you weak
To all my niggas first time stepping in the pen
Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
To all my niggas thats gon fuck around and die today
Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray, just wanna say
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Dont stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Dont stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah
Now how the fuck Im posed to say this?
You see my nigga just lost his son
While Im here hugging on my daughter, I grip her harder
Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinking of some bullshit to tell him
Like Itll be okay, youll be straight, itll be aight
Well, fuck that shit
Whatever you need, yo, I got it!
Whether its money or some weed or putting in work
Fuck it, then Im riding
You know whats up, but now a nigga couldnt stick around
Told myself that after yall moved
That Id be a fuckin fool, to be living by the street rules
Fuck police tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith
Stay strong, bruh, remain solid, bruh
Keep playing ball, cuz
Its the only way up out it, bruh, a nigga proud of ya
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed
Ill have whatever he needs, we the last of a dying breed
Live life, smoke trees
See how far weve come but most, Im sorry for your son
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Dont stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Dont stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah
And you aint gotta shed no tear
Ill be everywhere but Ima always be right here
I aint forgot those years
Ill be everywhere but Ima always be right here
Living in a premature place, wait
Never grow to see the pearly gates, break
Every time a bullet detonate, dates
Of obituary carry crates
Of a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, coming from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didnt hit the block again
Thats because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read gain
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody aint blessed, my nigga
Yes, my nigga, youre blessed, take advantage, do your best, my nigga
Dont stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga
You reject these niggas that neglect your respect
For the progress of a baby step, my nigga
Step-step my nigga, one, two, skip-skip
Back-back, look both ways, pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you cant flip
This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
Get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city youve built
Thats that, dont trip, see money, fuck niggas, dog
It aint nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas, dog
In a minute everybody gon be winning
Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all
Blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Dont stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah
Part I: Stay Ready
We do not exist in
Any other instant
Here in this dimension
You and I are meant to be
I have waited lifetimes to find you
Now that youre here
I can remind you
Of the things youve been dreaming
Times two
I promise you
If you just give me 24
Man, all I need is 24 hours
I promise youll want plenty more
Youve probably been waiting forever
So how does it sound:
Us on the ground
Giving you my love?
Theres no place quite like here
Theres no better time than now
You gotta stay ready
Theres no place quite like here
Theres no better time than now
Thats why I stay ready
Tell me find your spot with the warning that I might slip
And when you climb on top thats the ultimate road trip
Ride on me like your Pac got me thinkin its 96
I can rap on some nineties shit, wrap your leggings around my hip
Im so hip to it, tourists want to come speculate
But if I stay monogamous promise this kiss will always taste like candy
And, yeah, its obvious momma now probably cant stand me
Im sure theyre tired of this look that you have when youre antsy
We gon fuck around , we gon fuck around
And triple through triplets of babies right now
And that might break the record and no, that dont mean youre fertile
That means were fucking reckless, plus we dont use protection
I find myself reading old text messages when Im bored
We find ourselves sexting til that connection is restored
I know that sounds immature, but if we never grow up
Then I wish you good luck on the seats thats inside this Porsche
Come to me, come, come to me
Look at what youve done to me
You put a gun to me
Then you brought the sun to me
Shine like blood diamonds
Learning to have patience only cause you are timeless
The universe energy doesnt lie
And this chemistry is infinity at a million times
I wrote a million rhymes describing your star power
And after 24 bars, you get 24 hours
Theres no place quite like here
Theres no better time than now
You gotta stay ready
Theres no place quite like here
Theres no better time than now
Thats why I stay ready
All that I know is right now
Nothings for sure but, right now
Gotta get yours like, right now
All that I know is right now
Nothings for sure but, right now
Gotta get yours like, right now
Part II: What a Life
All that I know is right now
Nothings for sure but, right now
Gotta get yours like, right now
I been through some shit man
But I be on my shit man
I decided
That what you give
Is what youre given
So I been tryna do it right
I been doin like
Whatever gets me through the night
What a life
Im steady always on the go
You steady always on the go
We steady losing all control
What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life
They say
The truth aint pretty
But coming from that pretty mouth
The truth is fitting
Cause you aint never talkin loud
And you know plenty
Yeah, you know what Im talkin bout
Cause you just get me
Yeah, you so pretty
If everything is dipped in gold
Then, baby, it will never grow
Everything sweet aint sugar coated
What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life that Ive been given
What a life
What a life that Ive been living
What a life
What a life we die to live in
What a life

Dont you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through

Open the streets and watch our beliefs

Cause I need freedom, too!
I break chains all by myself

If you leave this time, I fear that youll be gone for good, so
And I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and he said hell be back
With that same tone that you just said youll stay forever with
Ooh
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like youre the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh
It seems that youre the only reason for it
Ive been bleeding in your silence, I feel safer in your violence
I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Before I sleep I talk to God, he must be mad with me, its karma
Im confused who Ill spend my forever with, oh-oh-oh
Ooh
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like youre the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
So the iceberg never broke
And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked 
And I poked at it but it stayed stagnant
Then I poked at it some more 
And in my notepad, man, I wrote 
If I dont have it, if I dont grab it
If it dont chip, then a toe tag is one last, Ima hope 
So iceberg dont float 
If I do manage to do damage to you, dammit
Itll be grand as, ten Grammies on my granite, still standin with a note 
That read, Granted, dont you panic
When you make mistakes the most 
One day, itll make you grow 
When you outlandish and you lose manners, to God you shall consult 
When the bright cameras are still crammin in your face and it provoke 
You to act mannish, just stay planted cause you reapin what you sowed
Keep positivity in your heart and 
Keep a noose from round your throat and 
When you get mad and when you poke at it
When you poke it at just note, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you renew your vision
Just think if it had sunk Titanic, the fuck it would do to a critic, my nigga?
Yeah, yeah
Tell me, when thugs cry, do you hear em, Lord?
Do you hear em, Lord? Do you hear em?
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?
And they wont let me live, even with remorse that I give
When they gon rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive
When they never see good in me
Even though I got hood in me, dont mean he wont redeem me, Lord
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like youre the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh
Ooh-ooh
Woman moaning
Ooh
Real niggas do not deserve pussy
Meaning its more, you see right through walls
Aint talkin about pussy
Meaning you deserve the whole box of chocolates
Come with me, Forrest Gump had a lot goin for him
Never without pussy, yknow, Jenny almost gave it all up for him
Never even pushed for the pussy
Wheres Forrest now when you need him?
Talk to me, talk to me, hey, ayy, hey
Attention, all you niggas, all you bitches
Sit back and relax your mind, just ride, just ride
Sit back and relax, youll find just why, just why
Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
You are now watching MADtv
Niggasll lose they mind for it, wine for it, dine for it—pussy
Spend time for it, see no colored line for it—pussy
Double back handicap and go blind for it—pussy
Pussy got endless prisoners, pussy always revengin her
Pussy is calculating and good pussy is rather dangerous
Pussy can be so facetious, the heavyweight champ
Pussy is so undefeated, lets amen to that
I mean, the pump fakes on the Facebooks
And the screw face when the bae look
Wont get you no pussy
I mean, the fake chains and the code names
For insecure, gon reassure you not to get pussy
You overcompensate too much for the pussy
You like to throw all kinda shade for the pussy
See, thats what pussy niggas do
I know the ways of a pussy, I see pussy lookin at you
How many niggas get mistaken for clitoris in a day?
How many sentiments you make before runnin pussy away?
How many times she gotta tell you that dick is disposable?
But if she fuck a young nigga like me, its over for you
Solána, middle fingers up, speak your truth
You could never trivialize pussy
But a bum nigga like you would try it 
I know what you really bout
High key, your beep is weak buddy
Its only replaced by a rubber substitute
We aint feelin you
I think I caught a vibe, kinda feel a nigga
You could touch the booty if you like, I aint trippin on ya
Im really tryna crack off on the headboard
And bust it wide open for the right one
Is you that for me?
Cause if you that for me
Like doves in the wind, hey, hey
Pussy, like doves in the wind, hey, hey
Pussy like doves in the wind
I will make you beg for it
I wanna see you crawl
Attention, all you niggas, all you bitches
Ill give you all of me and I wont stop, not a little bit
Make you beg for it, I wanted to do it all
Unfortunately you couldnt get your shit together
You are now watching MADtv
We take things, and my influence so far, and then its out of my hands. And, yknow, while as I said it can be scary, it can also be a little bit comforting. Because Ive learned that when I get to that point, and I can acknowledge, Okay, Audrey, thats as much as you can do, I can actually let it go...
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby
Look inside these walls and you see Im havin withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
Track attire just tell you Im tired and ran away
I should ask a choir: What do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?
As the record spin I should pray
For the record, I recognize that Im easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity buildin, its probly big as a buildin
Me jumpin off of the roof is me just playin it safe
But what am I posed to do when the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I aint
But know Im accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walkin from Bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I dont mind cause one day youll respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d city
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby
All I see is strobe lights, blindin me in my hindsight
Findin me by myself, promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head-on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignorin my purpose to persevere
As a better person; I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I posed to do when the blinkin of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
And you ask: Lift up your shirt, because you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that dont matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard em chatter: Hes probly young, but I know that hes down
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet-proof vest
He dont mind, he know well never respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city.
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby
All I see in this room: 20s, Xannies and these shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane
Society? Its entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room with 20s, Xannies and shrooms
Some grown-up candy, I lost it, I feel its nothin to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Dont mind, cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby
You said youd never ever break... down
But here I am sweeping... pieces off of the ground
You said youd never, ever play... to crowds

Ive spent all night long scared of tomorrow, I broke my alarm
Everything is almost lost, pick it up slow, before its gone...
We’re fragile

N9na be givin the remedy and why?
Critics are really the enemy and I
Cant stand the way they slam todays gifted
Effin incredible, get fanned away with grands to pay
This jam will lay scripted
Deaf and impeccable
Write a rhyme and I put everything in a flow
Im the N9ne Ima look very mean
When a foe scribe a line but he has never been at a show
By the times itll be better, leave it in the sto
Cause they wrote nothin but lies, quotes stuck in my eyes
Amateur writer dissin
Hes a beginner and hopes for your demise, folks Ima despise
Never do try to listen
Its real - Im mad
Clueless when you scribble on your pad
How you gonna criticize with a chisel on your nads sizzling your ad
You dont really get why Im so pissed? Understand this:
Im an artist, and Im sensitive about my shit, yes Im
We’re fragile
I never thought I’d be so fragile

Tell me that my name is
Big as Venus Jupiter and then Uranus
Tell me that your anus got your head in it
I can smell the articles and know youre heinous
Tell me that you love me, always thinkin of me
Unconditional, Im hoping Im your favourite
Grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks
Thats the feelin I get when youre concentratin
On this pen, on this pad
Tell me youre willin to diss on my craft
Tell me the feelin of pickin apart this track
Stop...
Puttin my heart and my soul in these lines
Tellin me platinum and gold all the time
Lookin to bury, a deep hole for mine
Drop...
This is more than you, and this is more than you
And your entire building slanderin and abusin
What I call the realest comin from a student
Told myself to use a poem as an UZI
Empty magazine, I seen a magazine
You seen my trigger finger, then I started shootin
That was nicotine, Im bout to smoke em all
And journalists involved shouldve known my music
We’re fragile
I never thought I’d be so fragile
If it didn’t break before, it’s about to
I don’t ever want to change

On that Fuck you, bitch, where the pay pay?
Make em pull up on your block with them 223s
Aim it at your face, hey
Movin with the rock and the Glock concealers

Hold your breath, Im 8 feet when I hold this TEC
Protect me from the local threats
My ID say my eye dont rest
My IV qualify T-Rex
Society kept my IQ vexed
Denyin me from an Ivy school
Applyin me to the street I slept
I quietly had to hold this tool
Reminding me of the block I repped
The turf I stepped, the church and the earth I blessed
The first I guessed the alert was the murk I chef
That hearse the flirt with perks of a kill confessed
Dispersed the worst, the first 48 addressed
The search of laws and verse of the birth I nest
The—uh, the awe, the curse of a pose in zest
The good, the flaws, the pain to reverse whats left, uh
Me no conversate with the fake——that part
All my bitches independent bitches—that part
I just want the paper—that part
All my bitches flavored
That part, that part, that part, that part, ayy

Where the fuck Ive been hidin in

New work that take em to church and
Turn the universe upside down again
Since youre so smart
I cant get in my groove til we get the Q first
Do what thou will not
Yo, my pool of thought large enough to part the Red Sea
Father forgive em for they know not know who they see
I got all eyes on me, call me 3Pac
Soulo
Hang on, nigga, let me get some
Hang on, nigga
Hang on
Made a mil and I spent it in the same day 
Got a chopper, not the AK 
Gettin money on a vacay 
Go go gadgets in the driveway 
Groovy Tony in July 8th
Yeah, Im killin kitties on a Sunday 
How you ballin in a Hyundai?
My Ferrari got a toupee
Swerve in the big body
Your favorite artist, Im his big homie
Yeah Im walkin with a fifth
And I aint votin, Im a Crip, homie 
Im where them Bloods, where them Locs at 
Where the blood, where the choke round
Gloves for the combat 
How the feds in your contacts?
How the feds know my set name?
Fled in the Mulsanne 
Hydrate up the rap game
Heard Soulo comin up next
And SZA got a classic, nigga
Heard Zay just got it mastered, uh
The fire burnin through the plastic
So fingers to the badges 
They dont love you til the racks evolve
When I was broke they wouldnt accept the call
Now they on me for my decimals
Blank Face has gotta X em off
Enemies gotta bob and weave
Gangbangin like we stand for somethin
When Alton Sterling gettin killed for nothin
Two cowards in the car, theyre just there to film
Sayin #BlackLivesMatter, shouldve died with him
Wrong nigga in your hood, you gon ride on him
White nigga with a badge, you gon let that slide?
Tell me how they sent that footage off and slept that night
I feel bad that my daughter gotta live this life
Ill die for my daughter, gotta fight this fight
Put a Blank Face on, nigga, let that drop
That—that part
Oh, shit!
I need that
I need that sloppy
That sloppy 
Like a Chevy in quicksand
Yeah
That sloppy
This feelin is unmatched
This feelin is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap 
We dont share the same synonym, fall back 
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radios nemesis made me wack
My innocence limited, the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did it, in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it, wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin, scratchin diligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now, I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin Benjamin benefits, sinnin in traffic
Spinnin women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin in every decision, Kendrick is master that mastered it
Isnt it lovely how menaces turned attraction?
Pivotin rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
Thank God for rap
I would say it got me a plaque, but whats better than that?
The fact it brought me back home
We been waitin for you
Waitin for you
Waitin for you
Waitin for you
I know everything
I know everything, know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything
I know Compton, I know street shit, I know shit thats conscious
I know everything, I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isnt meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes, and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those thats ornery
I know everything, the highs, the lows, the groupies, the junkies
I know if Im generous at heart, I dont need recognition
The way Im rewarded—well, thats Gods decision
I know you know that lines for Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip bout how it was distributed
I know how people work
I know the price of life, Im knowin how much it’s worth
I know what I know, and I know it well not to ever forget
Until I realized I didn’t know shit, the day I came home
We been waitin for you
Waitin for you
Waitin for you
Waitin for you
I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile, hand-me-down sneakers
Bounced through the crowd
Run a number on man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin on his beady beads, exhausted
Tossin footballs with his ashy, black ankles
Breakin new laws mama passed on home trainin
He looked at me and said, Kendrick, you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
Oh, I forgot, Dont Kill My Vibe, thats right, youre famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken
But never mind, youre here right now, dont you mistake it
Its just a new trip, take a glimpse of your family ancestor
Make a new list of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit, I know your life is full of turmoil
Spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin you
If you resist, Ill back off quick, go catch a flight or two
But if you pick destiny over rest-in-peace
Then be an advocate, tell your homies, especially
To come back home
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money or mankind?
Tell me something, got me losing my mind, ah!
You make me wanna jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Lets talk about love
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Lets talk about love
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Lets talk about love
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Lets talk about love
I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something, think Im losing my mind, ah!
I say, where you at? From the front to the back
Im lookin for you, I react only when you react
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 special
Maybe youre in a dollar bill, maybe youre not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe Im paranoid, ha, maybe I dont need you anyway
Dont lie to me, Im suicidal anyway
I can be your advocate
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is
Box
I would surely break the lock
Id jump right in and, and fall asleep, I, I fall asleep
Cause, cause, cause you, cause you are the death of me
Cause you are the—
If you was in a pine box, box
I would surely break the lock
Id jump right in and, and fall asleep, I, I fall asleep
Cause, cause, cause you, cause you are the death of me
Cause you are the—
The, the death of me, you, you, the death of me
Lookin in the mirror, Im embarrassed
Im feelin like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
Im in the matter of man, arm wrestlin hands I was dealt
When I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it, I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction thatd keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar
Women love when youre my type
And youre winnin from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance all cause the audience one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse bein read
Ima go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat, capitalize that
And your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Trackin device on your used 5 Series
I dont call back, just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say we in the area cruisin in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular, thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you cant see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors, all that nigga was missin was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality livin in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the tastemakers for the shit we makin
Then he said that he was the same age as
Myself, and it didnt help cause it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO
The reason why Im breathin all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend say she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why the highlight was when he said
You belong to the people when you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy
Full of fame and bury yourself alive, then I died
I fucked up the rap game and you aint even know it
I just fucked whats her name and you aint even know it 
She got a beep tattoo and you aint even know it 
We about to form a little group and you aint even know it, lets get it
Stuck in a rock and a hard place
Eminem, Pac and where God stay
Timberlands pop that jaw bone
Now bitch nigga, tell me how that tar taste
And even Tarzan can get swung on
I never hung out with the loud mouth
You got a foul mouth
And that dead body gon smell foul when it fouls out
She filed my nails in the Bahamas
We found ourselves in the Bahamas
She found God, meditation, and peace
I found myself without a condom
You know everybody having them babies
Its a beautiful thing it aint crazy
If a rapper monogamous, you know what the problem is?
Too many bitches got rabies
And I hate a ho-hoppin woman
Stank pussy-poppin woman
You fuckin fool dont know about you
But my dick need 17 years on it
Anything after that is just a bonus
And I been in the lab with my opponents
And since Sway done swayed that list
He got a flatscreen the next morning
Tell em I need my credit when its due
Tell em I need my lettuce when its new
Tell em I got a fetish for fine fabric, Franklins and saying, Fuck you
Tell em its TDE til Im DDTd in that grave
And Top Dawg is proof
til my nigga Whoo Kid get free, aint shit comin for free
Im bout to rape you niggas til you recoup
Its a groovy nigga, thats all day, Backwood hold three grams
Got a six-shooter, that revolver spinning, shell stuck inside, but wont jam
This hoody here about two stacks, hell yeah that bitch could gon go ham
Molly in her drink, but she asked me to and oh yeah I got this on cam
Gangsta nigga, no trap beats, bet I still sound like that new shit
Originality in my blueprint, still Figg side, Figueroa pimp
Her big ass where my palm hit, pull my dick out, she gon balm it
Swag surfin all through the world, slide through the sea on a comet
O-X-Y for these morons, that be that new shit Im pushin
Raise off of them pockets, bring more of them coffins
These niggas aint popping, tell them, old niggas, to move on
Aw damn I done said it, all them can beheaded
She aint single but she solo, you aint even know it
Unsigned with sold out shows, you aint even know it
My lips black but they ain’t chapped, she ain’t even know that
Let’s have sex, she said, Yes, you know she ain’t no that
Seed of life on my chest, my head next to her breast
My mind all in the clouds, just bought an ounce of the best
No talking when I’m off that loud
I came quick so she pissed
You know I’m good for another round
But it’s hard when everybody on your dick
Know real niggas that’s crips, I know real niggas that’s bloods
Know real niggas that’s thugging like you ain’t know what’s up
Got codeine in my cup, got a couple checks that need cashing
And you could take that to the bank, what’s life without a balance?
You aint even know it, nigga, I be everywhere you ain’t even going
I thought it was snowing, but I’m just the coldest nigga out here flowin
Sick of all that bullshit y’all been promoting, but 
Carson in the motherfucking house
Del Amo, watch your motherfucking mouth
I took the game by storm, just to X men out
Im crazy out my mind, I put my life on the line
The tortoise only makes progress when his neck sticks out
Just a little token of gold if you aint know it, though
Respect, I get the utmost
Im so dope Im a walking kilo
36 Os, you dont even know Im gettin cheese like Cheetos
You mad that we BMFing, bitch-ass niggas steady PMSing
I never show my hands, cant know my plans
Gotta keep them guessing
Rock, I was off the scene
Now a nigga back like a four and a half
Shooting up the set like Spielberg
See the big picture when them hammers flash
I dont post a lot on Instagram
Thats the quickest way theyll get you, man
Leave that shit for the bitches man
Alphabet boys, theyll get your ass
IRS, they was on a nigga
Cashed them out, now Im scot-free
Got my passport in my JanSport, now Im overseas
You dont even know it

Just 100 thousand cash on me
Back then, I was doing bad, homie
All my bitches bad now
My old hoes try to keep tabs on me
Safe to say Im the man now
Fuck ass nigga just stand down
Fore the shots go up and its man down
Hands down, still popping
No prescription, Im flexing
Suplex a pussy, Ive been off the edge
Too late to push me, nigga I aint fell off

Pull up to the bank, count paper like tellers
Top Dawg, Money Gang, bitch, weve been on
Clothesline the beat, nigga, John Cena
Been having stripes, cant walk in my Adidas

Yeah, yeah
Young Egypt
Look, look
I feel like Pacino in Godfather, Im charged
Our Father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin the odds
What an accomplishment, broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous till I dealt with the consequence
The greatest, the latest mogul, you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like yall fear God
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of making your choice in writin your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital, avenues lookin like evil dead zombies
With batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
Just premium gas, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist, die countin my coin
Hope its evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and beamers and blue leather
Forecastin my future, this is the future
The mastermind, until my next album, more power to you
Gunshot
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on , come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on
This is a fifteen minute song 
Were just jammin out, we on stage
Taz, we just jammin out 
Hundred thousand 
Hundred thousand, you gotta see it!
Look, look, look, go back to the down note
They all sing this shit, everybody
Now I dont let you down, down for
You see, you see, you see, you see 
But I dont shake you down, dog for you, you, you, you, uh
They say the government aint the truth, truth, truth, truth
And the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth
But head is the answer
Head is the future
Dont second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
Hey one more time, band, I need yall to help me out right now 
Head is the answer 
Head is the futu—its the future, that nigga said
Dont second guess yourself 
Come on, give me some help
Say come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on—my background singer—come on, come on 
Say, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
I said, girl, you make me wanna, uh
Great, the—the hos screaming now, uh 
I said baby you make
You make me wanna just, ah!
Baby, you got me speechless right now
I gotta take it there, I aint even playin no more
Uh, said you just make me wanna drag you down
To the ground, to the ground
Like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
Ju—you just make me wanna drag you down
To—down, around like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
And, baby, if your mamas around if your mamas around
If your mamas around if your mamas around
Tell her, tell her
No discrimination , she young nigga chasin 
And she can get this dick too!
I said come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Yeah, nigga
You gotta do it, man
We gonna lay that shit
We gonna lay that shit man and watch what its gon do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh
Whats wrong, nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta
I thought this what you wanted
They say if you scared, go to church
But remember, he knows the Bible too
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
Ima go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin, poking that doja til Im idle with you
Cause I 
Now, baby, when Im riding here, Im riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin, drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
Cause I 
I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
You looked me in my eyes about four, five times
Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified
That I 
You said Sherane aint got nothing on Lucy
I said, You crazy?
Roses are red, violets are blue
But me and you both pushing up daisies if I 
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
Ima go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin, poking that doja til Im idle with you
Cause I 
You said to me, you said your name was Lucy
I said, Wheres Ricardo?
You said, Oh, no, not the show
Then you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned twenty-six, I was like, Oh, shit
You said to me, I remember what you said too, you said:
My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick
Usually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon fill your pockets
Lucy gon move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
Its not so easy, Im at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy dont slack a minute, Lucy work harder
Lucy gon call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
Im Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy dont mind, cause at the end of the day youll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that’s possible
Get you, get you, get you, get you
Ima go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin, poking that doja til Im idle with you
Cause I 
Now, baby, when Im riding here, Im riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin, drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
Cause I 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin in the hotel room
I didnt wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin for answers
Until I came home

While only makin conscious albums?
How yall let the braids on TV?

All my old friends livin life on a slow end
Gotta keep shit rollin, its deep

Complexion 
Complexion dont mean a thing 
Complexion 
It all feels the same 
Uh, Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
Sneak 
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know Id go the distance, you know Im ten toes down
Even if master listenin, cover your ears, he bout to mention
Complexion 
Complexion dont mean a thing 
Oh, Complexion 
It all feels the same 
Dark as the midnight hour, or bright as the mornin sun
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama cant run
Sneak 
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know Id go the distance, you know Im ten toes down
Even if masters listenin, I got the worlds attention
So Ima say somethin thats vital and critical for survival
Of mankind, a feline color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then Whit told me, A woman is woman, love the creation
It all came from God, then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...
Complexion 
Complexion dont mean a thing 
Oh, Complexion 
It all feels the same 
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
(Where the homegirl Rapsody at?
I need you to speak your mind real quick, loved one!)
Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2Pac
Keep your head up, when did you stop loving thy
Color of your skin? Color of your eyes
That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay’s baby
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey
All my solemn men up north, 12 years a slave
12 years of age, thinkin my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
Enforcin my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don’t mean you smart, bein dark don’t make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin “Woo-hah!”
Need a paradox for the pair of docs they tutored
Like two Todds, L-L, you lose two times
If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion
It ain’t complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context
Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain’t no stress, jiggaboos wanna be
I ain’t talkin Jay, I ain’t talkin Bey
I’m talkin days we got school watchin movie screens
And spike your self-esteem
The new James Bond gon be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it’s all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, know colors ain’t a thing
Barefoot babies with no cares
Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car?
I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of the landmines, the hell that’s on earth
W-W-W-What is it?
Twenty-plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby-faced monster
No wonder theres diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm & Hammer and a Mason jar, thats my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a Minute Steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two-toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got their mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cutting school with his jewels on
Couldnt do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, Im a doctor
Zhivago, tried to fight the urge
Like Ivan Drago, If he dies, he dies
Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides, he rides
Throwing punches in his room, if he cries, he cries
We dont drink away the pain when a nigga die
We add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playin on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills, who gon fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale, digital, my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply cause its honest
Pure as the fumes that be fuckin with my sinus
Nigga, this is Simon Says, Simon, red
Blood on your diamonds til you dying – dead, yuugh!
You better change what comes out your speaker
You better change, ch-ch-change
Dee-dee-dee, dah-dee, dah-dee, dee-dee, dah-dee, day-ah 
You wanna see a dead body?
Instrumentals from my mommas Christmas party
Troubles on my mind
I still smell crime, my little brother crying
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis
Either that or my auntie was stealing it
Hit the pipe and start feeling it
Ooh, wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, geez, Louise, please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
And nine times out of ten, niggas dont pay attention
And when its tension in the air, nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter-piece to a four and a half
Took a L, started selling soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold
I said, Daddy, one day, Ima get you right with thirty-six zips
One thousand grams of cocaine, then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter
He said, Son, how come you think you be my connect?
I said, Pops, your ass is washed up, with all due respect
He said, Well, nigga, then show me how it all makes sense
Go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick
Your son dope, nigga!
Now reap what you sowed, nigga! 
I was born in 87, my granddaddy a legend
Now the same shit that yall was smoking is my profession
Lets get it
You better change what comes out your speaker
You better change ch-change, ch-change, ch-change, cha-ange
You better change what comes out your speaker
Th-Th-Th-Th-They must be on the dick of who?
Th-Th-Th-Th-They must be on the dick of who?

Deep in my bones, straight from inside
Bury me alive, bury me with pride
Bury me with berries, that forbidden fruit and cherry wine
Thank you berry much, but tonights my night and Im Barry Bonds
Swingin for the fences, barbaric Kendrick in idle time
Everything in lifes subject to change, change whip, change grind
Change clothes, change opinions, right before I change my mind
I dont really know yah business, been in there since I was bendin Lego blocks
Now you tell the world about me, dry snitch
Tater tots on my shotgun, now I gotta pop one at the stars
Skys the limit, I gotta finish as the first rapper on Mars
Mark my word, Ima make my mark, even when they start their Martial Law
Even when these Martians alienate, my mental state is still at heart
Fuck, look in my eyes, tell me I died, tell me I tried, to compromise
Tell me you love me, tell me that I, dont give a fuck and can barely decide
Wishin good luck on my enemies, all of my energy go to the almighty God
I could drown in a bottle of Hennessy, fuck your amenities, Im gettin better with time
AHHHHH!
Im wakin up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa, Im radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, Im radioactive, radioactive

Were far from good, not good from far
Ninety miles per hour down Compton Boulevard
With the top down, screamin, We dont give a fuck
Drink my forty-ounce of freedom while I roll my blunt
Cause the kids just aint alright
Oh shit, nigga
Somethin bout to happen
Nigga, this shit, nigga, this sound like thirty keys under the Compton court building
Hope the dogs dont smell it
Welcome to vigilante, 80s, so dont you ask me

Peelin off like a Xanny, examine my orchestra
Granny said when Im old enough, Ill be sure to be all I can be
You niggas Marcus Camby, washed up
Pussy, fix your panties, Im Mr. Marcus, you gettin fucked, uh
You aint heard nothin harder since Daddy Kane
Take it in vain, Vicodins couldnt ease the pain
Lightning bolts hit your body, you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write
Strong enough to stand in front of a travelin freight train, are you trained?
To go against Dracula, draggin the record industry by my fangs
AK clips, money clips, and gold chains
You walk around with a P90 like its the 90s
Bullet to your temple, your homicidell remind me
That Compton Crip niggas aint nothin to fuck with
Bompton Pirus aint nothin to fuck with
Compton éses aint nothin to fuck with
But they fuck with me, and bitch, I love it

Lets hit the county buildin, gotta cash my check
Spend it all on a forty-ounce to the neck
And in retrospect, I remember December being the hottest
Squad cars, neighborhood wars, and stolen Mazdas
I tell you motherfuckers that life is full of hydraulics
Up and down, get a six-four, better know how to drive it
Im drivin on E with no license or registration
Heart racin, racin past Johnny because hes racist
1987, the children of Ronald Reagan
Rake the leaves off your front porch with a machine blowtorch 
He blowin on stress, hopin to ease the stress 
He coppin some blow, hopin that it can stretch
Newborn massacre
Hoppin out the passenger with calendars cause your day comin
Run him down and then he gun him down, Im hopin that you fast enough
Even the legs of Michael Johnson dont mean nothin, because
Compton Crip niggas aint nothin to fuck with
Bompton Pirus aint nothin to fuck with
Compton éses aint nothin to fuck with
But they fuck with me, and bitch, I love it

Pour this shit, bonafide, woe is me
Bowl of grits, naked pimp, beamin up, clean as fuck

Hill for niggas, tip top cliff for niggas, this the vision side to side
So give the nigga, if we honest you gon miss a nigga
Twisted with em, this the isms
See your bitch might kiss a nigga, which nigga? Get specific
Big ass pot, wrist is glistened, your list is shit

Other niggas they Mobb like Carter say from far away
All my niggas like Calm down
Lovin life above a reason, just cant find it like a dozen people
Catch that vibe at night, and Bobby Whitney
Get too tired to write and died in prison
Felt like Rob tonight, lost my god tonight?
Oh sometimes I get so ahead of myself
Feel like Im runnin in circles
Oh and Im just holdin onto my breath
I need smoke just to exhale
Oh and I get so ahead of myself
But Ill make it out somehow
So roll another, roll another one
And put it all in the air now
Lets go
How many souls do you touch a day?
How many hoes do you fuck a day?
How many flows do your thought convey?
How many know you cant walk away?
Depending on the way I feel, I might kill everybody around me
Might heal everybody around me, how the wind blow
Open your window, let the debris in, never let me in
I kick back with kick do
Maybe if I could live hundred years that be real?
Pay me if Ima be rhymin these homonyms
Crazy, my other show went to my mom n em
My daddy said a Mercedes had haunted him
But now he got one, Im ridin shotgun
With a three-piece chicken dinner and shot gun
I bring your weekend to an ending and pop one
Im in the deep end, boss nigga you not one
And I believe in Kool-Aid and Gods son
Do you believe that Black man is our sun?
I made enough residuals to hide some
I gave enough, my niggas know I divide some
I told Zay, Im the best rapper since twenty-five
Been like that for a while now, Im twenty-nine
Any nigga that disagree is a fuckin liar
Pardon me, see my alter ego was Gemini
Him and I been around ever since Reagan was criticized
Might stay in the Trump Tower for one week
Spray paint all the walls and smoke weed
Fuck them and fuck yall and fuck me
I proceed my last check in proceeds
To all the kids, the hood, the bricks, the books
To fix the blocks we on to right my wrongs
The word, to give the life we live as I get...

Feel like Im runnin in circles
Oh and Im just holdin onto my breath
I need smoke just to exhale
Oh and I get so ahead of myself
But Ill make it out somehow
So roll another, roll another one
And put it all in the air now

Oh you got two Xannies, oh, just dont forget me
Love me for the moment hug me like your sibling

Grew with Apollonia Rob was makin chicken
Beat me down, you beat me down, reorganize my face
Now when I go home, I dont know what my fam gon say
Zay, say it aint love cause you bought flowers yesterday
Thoughts was always cheap, cheap, cheap
But now lets talk bout me, me, me
Lately I been comin, this aint goin how I wanted
When I pull up at your window, bitch come out, you hear that beep, beep, beep
Faithful as your EBT, closer than you momma kin
Anger when you rang about my dog but Im gon call again
Freak me out, keep me out, why they always leave me out
Niggas that been hatin just cant wait to have my CD now

We keep our distance from those, those acting like hoes
Xanny imposed, weed in my clothes, cubics is gold
Your wigll get told, put the realest niggas
Niggas, product of cap-peelers, gangbangers, and dealers
Streets keep watching—Oh, ayy... click, boom
The ghetto bird get shot down, straight to the top now
They want a third strike on my background
But nah, homie, put the mask on when I slide on em
Put the cash in the safe, and heres a extra slug fore I shake
You smoke faster than me with a eighth
Or better yet, a wet break on a plate
Burning your faith, all your senses covered in tape
Fucking with them boys in blue
Chill out before I send them rags at you
You running to the cops saying, How we do?
Saying, Its just rap, and them lines aint true
So I just do Q, fuck it, a ménage à two
Or maybe trois, baby girl need a papa, I be her da-da
Coochie spanking, give praise to Allah
Get blazed in my car, with Oxymoron—Rock
Rock got it, Rock came from rock bottom
Sparked the flames, still remain as a top shotta
I aint no backpack rapper, I aint no lyricist
And if we aint talking to you, mind your business, then
Cold with it, Black Hippy, yeah, we cold niggas
All the girlies love us, get a whiff of us, they bones quiver
Heard some clowns throwing stones at us
Holding boulders, champ
Once you hear that YAWK, watch the domes shatter
Its Top Dawg, we running rap
Wack rappers feline, reason why we dont run with cats
Nine-double O-five-nine, where my family at
Pull up in that family van, holding tools like the handyman
And to be real, not with all this rapping, politicking
Rapper competition, wrapped up my position
Til Im finished, til I make a couple tickets, then Im outty
On them islands with my crimeys, chilling, hide your feelings
Now, can I live?
Look, I gotta keep my feet on top of the dirt
Cause everywhere I go, they like, When you dropping some work?
Been a threat since birth
The rap games pallbearer when Im dropping the hearse
I aint new to this, Im true to this, industrys nightmare
Red strings in my Nike Airs, yeah, the white pair
Im Jay Rock, Americas most wanted
My charges? Killing emcees without warning
Rock!
Yeah, its Ab-Soul, gimme the loot, Im the skinny Biggie
In New York City with Puffy, puffing the sticky
All odds against me, still even the score
Prolly why Im always OT, on tour

I dont even know what piece I like most no more
Two fingers, two triggers, whats the difference?
We all gon die one day, and til then, Im gettin paid
My grandma watching, so I aint gon curse
Still gifted like a Wale verse
Backwood full of OG Bobby Johnson
Medicine in my soda, tryna dodge the coffin, ah
And these days are so bittersweet
I guess its just a balance, we battle naturally
And yall still tripping off of JAY-Z tweet
I still got laps to run when me and JAY-Z meet—peep
Soul Brother No. 2

Passing propellers, I tell her, tell her, We flying, just listen

Brought sand to the beach, and we left with your bitches
For the record in Guinness, Im a heckling menace
Wheres Robin? Im giving, fucking minding my business

Regular niggas, you always cater to sluts
You always wasting my time, you always faking the funk

And keep looking for some women to be all in your face
That deep dussy, rich nigga, king dussy
That Tennessee dussy make a nigga be dussy
You could never rap better than me
Cause you aint dedicated, you aint underrated
You aint underlooked, you aint undercooked, you just underbooked

Now they got me out here by myself, still fresh as fuck
I hate yall, Id do anything to replace yall

Pacing back and forth, racing, my thoughts on them racing Daytons
I spilled blood on my apron cooking this shit up
I feel like some of yall is hating
Quite frankly, your bitch booty should thank me for grabbing it
Turn these hoodrats to actresses, what a magic trick
Accidents never happen when murders involved
Immaculate tactics, so follow me, if you need me, just call on me
I say, Hold up, wait a minute
Your career aint shit unless you got some Kendrick in it
You pussies aint shit, aint no room is left on my dick
Less you look like Jordin Spark, make my mark on that clitoris, mwah

Family jewels big as fuck, and I got the balls to say it
Balls-deep, balling out til Spalding need a replacement

The white court building, spilling its Merlot
Fillin women, a Virgo pimped the industry
Member these Stacey Adams and fur-coats
Shook, youre scared to death
Youre scared to look in the mirror when Kendrick is near you—
King Kendrick!
So I met this young lady, ya know, when I went back home. I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like snaps. I said You know what, girl? You crazy. Then she asked me what he said...
 A peace of mind
Thats what the Asian said—I need a divine
Intervention was his religion and I was surprised
Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God
Asked him what are you doing, he said taking my time
Meditation is a must, it dont hurt if you try
See you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career, you ever think of your health?
 A piece of land
Thats what the Indian said—I needed the man
Telling me longevity is in the dirt
Should buy some property first
Should profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best, really, you should invest
These tangible things expire, dont you expect
Income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage, we blessed
 A piece of pussy
Thats what the black man said I needed to push me
To the limit, to satisfy my hunger
We do it all for a woman from haircut to a war
We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach
What you saying to me?
He said nigga, come back to reality for a week
Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night
I wouldnt be prouder, you should allow it
 A piece of mines
Thats what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99
If I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said it dont even matter
You make a million or more, you living better than average
You losing your core following, gaining it all
He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
Look at what you accomplishing; what he said to the boy
Ima make you some promises that you just cant ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist if I dont target your market
If you aint signing your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
Your world tour, your masters, mortgage, I need a piece
I holler, What you do? What you say?
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today
I holler, What you do? What you say?
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today
What the black man say?
Tell em we dont die, tell em we dont die
Tell em we dont die, we multiply
Tell em we dont die, tell em we dont die
Tell em we dont die, we multiply
Tell em we dont die, tell em we dont die
Tell em we dont die, we multiply
Tell em we dont die, tell em we dont die
Tell em we dont die, we multiply

Tell them mothafuckas Im forever paid
California king, wrestle gators in that Everglade
Drive up out that mothafuckin swamp in the Escalade
So before you put that red rag in your pocket
I wanna see your fuckin résumé
Started off on Ground Zero, then I start to levitate
Rip rappers a new asshole – I never hesitate
Dre Beats on, smokin that chronic just to meditate
Ima give em hurricanes until another levee break
You niggas is featherweight, Im Aftermaths heavyweight
Now Dres weapon of mass destruction is bout to detonate
When a nigga Wack found me, shit, I was sellin weight
Now a niggas sellin millions, now its time to celebrate
Performin in front of millions, nigga, every race
6-4 in the 64, now watch the Chevy scrape
Fourth album, no five mics? Then let em hate!
But Im not stoppin till Im the fuckin king in every state
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
Im a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, Ima wreck it, even if my record dont pop
Ima tie a knot on a downtown buildin
Let it tow behind me, tell em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me
Im sick of mothafuckas talkin about the West died
Cant you hear my heart beatin? Thats the motherfuckin Westside
You test me, you test God, Im His son
It say in Psalms, you come at me
Then I can split you with this Tommy gun
You wont have no time to run
Im from the Compton slums, and thats how the West ride
Im from the city where two of the best died
Rest in peace to both of em, spit like Im the ghost of em
Damn, I said I spit like Im the ghost of em
Name your top 10, Im harder than the most of em
Matter of fact, shorten your list, nigga, top 5
Game, Biggie, Hov… probably Pac, Nas
No particular order, bet a mill that I slaughter
And serve niggas, give a fuck what you ordered
How dare you niggas pop fly
When Im the nigga sold 5 mill out the gate and numbers do not lie
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
Im a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, Ima wreck it, even if my record dont pop
Ima tie a knot on a downtown buildin
Let it tow behind me, tell em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me
I gave you The Documentary, shit was a classic
Gave you Doctors Advocate, you ripped it out the package
Came with LAX, since critics said it was average
I was stressed the fuck out, torn between Aftermath and
Geffen, Interscope, now I got you in the scope
Spill the red ink on the paper, its like my pen is broke
And this is what you all been waitin for
Im the lost angel knockin on Satans door
What the fuck yall take me for?
I love you ‘cause you hate me more
Im Kobe on the Lakers floor, except I give you 84
Shake you like Haitis floor
Walk up on you, like, Whats goin on, baby boy?
Shots in that Mercedes door
Either Im crazy or the black Slim Shady or
Could that be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more?
But I still owe Jimmy one more album
The best the West has ever seen, no disrespect to Calvin
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
Im a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, Ima wreck it, even if my record dont pop
Ima tie a knot on a downtown buildin
Let it tow behind me, tell em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me
Kendrick, and I wear pendant on my shoulder
Soldier, like a lieutenant
And the coupe tinted, got pulled over
Johnny always lock a nigga down, knowin damn well
We dont wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size
Ride like Pac in his prime; Thug Life is now on radar
Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscin when the L.A. Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncles dome
And I dont condone dickridin
Im addicted to Westsidin
Livin in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turned me to a lion
Tryin… and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city where a nigga hadnt seen that shit
Compton! – a nigga gotta scream that shit
Never went commercial, never TV-screened that shit
Cant block or screen that shit
Now everybody sing that shit!
Red is a very emotionally and intense color. It enhances human metabolism, increases respiration rate, and raises blood pressure. It has a very high visibility, which is why stop signs, stop lights, and fire equipments are usually painted red. It also represents one third of Californias gang population. Needless to say, please dress accordingly while visiting the Los Angeles area. Also, tuck your jewellry, and keep your hands inside your vehicle. Thank you! Enjoy it!
Uh, shoutout to ScHoolboy Q
He uglier than a motherfucker 
Tire marks, tire marks
Finish line with the tire marks
When the relay starts I’m a runaway slave
Ugh, walking on water and running on waves
God MC, oh my God, you gotta see
There’s never no Is in me
Of an Odyssey, I’m a block away
Fire marshals moving in
Marshmallows inside my pen
Sweet sixteens
Got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
I’m so appalled
With the prototype with a godly protocol
You an amateur, they wanna pro to call
I damage ya on camera, in Compton, in Canada
I don’t care where ya are
Just blink twice and I’m there where you are
Like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat
In an ocean full of sharks bout to come up short
Water in the pot, flow crack rock like Bam Bam nigga
Have two grams nigga pay up or blam blam nigga
Had a black Camry, bumpin Dipset, Killa Cam nigga
I had been around niggas, killas, pimps
You ain’t been around shit but your momma and your bitch
Shoved off the porch when I was like six
Uncle Bobby got the house raided back in 9-6
Kick in the door
K9s all in the kitchen way before I even heard of Mike Vick
Momma in the bathroom poppa at work
Happened on Sunday we shoulda went to Church
Look at my shirt, Polo on it
It’s gon sell if my logo on it
I fear no opponent
A demon come near and I might throw a spear at the omen
You looking at the 2010 Romans
Empire, Hiiipower HP, in ya face like HD
And I spit like a HK
I’ma shot like a H3, H-U-B-C-I-T-Y, A-B and Y-G
Problem and Hootie nigga
Tell the government come shoot me, nigga
Cause I’m going out with a fist raised
And a fist full of money give it to the fifth grade
Drink a fifth of Hennessy and then take another fade
With a democratic politician from CA
They don’t wanna see a B-L-A-C-K
Making some scratch like a hall of fame DJ
Give us some free J’s put us in PJs
Now we in the county jail calling for a three-way
God-Damn, yall cold
Mark of the beast wear your god damn bar-code
Stuck in the street where its dark like Harpo
Black man tell me where your God-Damn heart go
Although I’m in the land of milk and honey
Nobody never gave me shit, when I got my first chain
All the niggas tried to take it from me
I had to fight back and shit
Take it back and shit
And you rap niggas looking funny tryna talk back and shit
Like he back that shit
Acting like you real or something
Nigga aint popped no steel, aint popped no collar
Go pop some pills or something
You trying real hard to appeal to someone
I’m being myself, my BFF is a BM-dub
With your BM in it and your stash box glove
And the medicine a doctor gave a nigga wont help
I’m at the limit where I be amazing myself
I bet I finish on a level with a Black belt
I bet I hit it where every rapper get killed, like
Bla bla bla bla where the knife at?
Cut cut cut where your life at?
Your careers over, he’s slumped over
And if Im off beat know I’m un-sober
Thats a new flow
Pl-, Plus Q gave me some Kush and some Nuvo
New dough for the new year and I sumo on a rap peer
Not a rapper, I’m a raptor
Thats a T-Rex in a V-neck for the rapture
I’m a factor and your facial
I will fracture to a fraction
No one-half and I hate math
Pastor’s like Eddie long, fucking maricon
Took me mighty long to get here
Nigga, Fuck!
Doing what I gotta do, aaaa
What up though?
We the best music...
I guess Im on my Don shit
What that mean?
Ima go, aaaa
DJ Khaled
Straight up, late nights mixed with early days
Itll probably be that way until the pearly gates
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man
Sheesh, at least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy its never going south less we down in South Beach
Khaled on the jet skis, preaching what you believe in
Everything fast cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know its true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way Ima take it
Just like its fuckin taxes
No wonder Im on fire, I done been to hell and back bitch
Lately I been living life in detachment
I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions
We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting
Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion
Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies
Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body
Niggas over stressing, we under investigation
Every day off to the races, cant fuck with you if you racist
Beat your ass until you purple
They cant even tell what your race is
Doctor King meet Dr. Dre
Except this doctor lost all his patience
Have you tied up in a basement
With you and your partner facing adjacent
Until you deposit payment or reparations
If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
It feel like Im finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key
And Ima celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldnt break me, now its all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And Ima celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldnt break me, now its all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust 
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust 
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I dont wear crosses no more, Yeshuas coming back
I aint scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I dont resonate with the concept of love and hate
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said Fuck Mother Earth, thats PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifers spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my familys in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubiks cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches
Sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your bosss employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Two new Royces with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason
You wont die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, dont you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it
Lets play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
Im restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I dont like to sleep, Im up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, Im off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix
Oh yeah, mhm yeah
And Ima celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldnt break me, now its all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And Ima celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldnt break me, now its all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
Holy, Holy key, holy
I am Killmonger
No ones perfect
But no ones worthless

But word is, good, 
Said no ones perfect, but no ones worth this
We aint deservin of everything heaven and Earth is
But word is, good

Thumbin through a 100 racks just to kill time
They got a nigga at the edge, but I feel fine
But it come with this shit, Im okay with it
If your mans to his last share a plate wit em

New baby chop, let it sing, its a Drake nigga
A lot of shit on my mind make me think a lot
Why its hard for me to smile? Cause I seen a lot
You aint really in the field, you just tweet a lot
If we aint on the same page, you can kick a rock, bitch!
And I been really tryna keep the peace
But Im a north Vallejo nigga, and Im heavy in the streets
I was raised by my granny and the gangsters
So at eight I made the choice Ima forever be a G, and
I dont really like to talk
I remember we was broke and I dont really like to walk, nigga
Now I ride around in foreign cars
And I put on for my team who was with me from the start, nigga
I dont play games, stitch lip, I dont say names
She want a dog, Im a Great Dane
I got great aim, Ice Age on my damn chain
My momma told me keep a stash for the damn rain
They aint wanna see me win cause Im black
So I pulled up in that all black Benz in the back
If you need someone to call, Im the man for the task
You aint standin for the cause, meet the man in the mask

But talk behind my back every time Im gone
So when they call my number, I dont never pick up

You actin like a hoe, you actin like a hoe
You actin like a hoe, niggas actin like a hoe

Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
Uh, and Lord knows shes beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur, thats her favorite rapper
Bumpin Brendas Got a Baby while a pervert yellin at her
And she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen
Then seven cars start honking
She start running like Flo-Jo, dont care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough, dont see a dime of dirty dollars
Just give it all to her daddy, but she dont know her father
Thats ironic
See, a block away from Lueders Park, I seen an El Camino parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothin really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she makin ends meet
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
And Lord knows shes beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
Her anatomy is Gods temple
And its quite simple, her castle is bout to be destroyed
Shes always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
Undercovers, the dummies that look like decoys
Remember sergeant let her slide
Said if he seen whats between her thighs, hed compromise
To no surprise
She took the ultimatum round the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome, then felt him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she toppin off police
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
And Lord knows shes beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
As she bust down like a twelve-bunk on tour
She suddenly realize shell never escape the allure
Of a Black man, white man needing satisfaction
At first, it became a practice, but now shes numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners redemption, that sounds foolish
And you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten, he moved in and thats when he touched her
This motherfucker is the fuckin reason why Keisha rushing to that
Block away from Lueders Park, I seen an El Camino parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat
Then caught a knife inside the bladder, left for dead, raped in the street
Keishas song, mmm
My little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face
The day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard, oh
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
Study long, study wrong, nigga
Hey, yall close that front door, yall let flies in this motherfucker
Close that door!
My OG up in this motherfucker right now
My pops man with the bottle of Hennessy in his hand, actin a fool
Hey, hey, babe, check it out, Ima tell you what my mama had said, she like:
I could spot you a mile away
I could see your insecurities written all on your face
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say
Who you foolin? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
With the homies but your level of realness aint the same
Circus acts only attract those that entertain
Small talk, we know that its all talk
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name
Askin where the hoes at? to impress me
Askin where the moneybags? to impress me
Say you got the burner stashed to impress me
Its all in your head, homie
Askin where the plug at? to impress me
Askin where the juug at? to impress me
Askin where its at? only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie
You aint gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You aint gotta lie, you aint gotta lie
You aint gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You aint gotta try so hard
You aint gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You aint gotta lie, you aint gotta lie
You aint gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You aint gotta try so hard
And the world dont respect you
And the culture dont accept you
But you think its all love
And the girls gon neglect you once your parody is done
Reputation cant protect you if you never had one
Jealousy , emotional 
Self-pity , under oath 
The loudest one in the room, nigga, thats a complex
Let me put it back in proper context
You aint gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You aint gotta lie, you aint gotta lie
You aint gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You aint gotta try so hard
You aint gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You aint gotta lie, you aint gotta lie
You aint gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You aint gotta try so hard
Askin where the hoes at? to impress me
Askin where the moneybags? to impress me
Say you got the burner stashed to impress me
Its all in your head, homie
Askin where the plug at? to impress me
Askin where the juug at? to impress me
Askin where its at? only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie
What do you got to offer?
Tell me before we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin, been a virgin to bullshit
And sell a dream in the auction, tell me just who your boss is
Niggas be fugazi, bitches be fugazi
This is for fugazi
Niggas and bitches who make habitual lyin babies
Bless them little hearts
You can never persuade me
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
Or you, the truth you love to bend
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, thats your ho
On the couch, in the mouth, Ill be out, really though
See, loud, rich niggas got low money
And loud, broke niggas got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year
Pass on some advice we feel:
You aint gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You aint gotta lie, you aint gotta lie
You aint gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You aint gotta try so hard
You aint gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You aint gotta lie, you aint gotta lie
You aint gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You aint gotta try so hard
I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
Theyll probably think Im a terrorist, eat my asparagus
Then Im asking her thoughts of a young nigga
Fast money and freedom, a crash dummy for dollars
I know you dying to meet him, Ill probably die in a minute
Just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million, and a Comptown fitted
Hol up , hol up 
Hol up , hol up 
Yeah, big shit poppin
Section.80
Back in this bitch, in the back of that bitch
With my back against the wall and your bitch on the edge of my dick, jump off
I call a bitch a bitch, a ho a ho, a woman a woman
I never did nothing but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that Im easily peddlin
With the speed of a lightning bolt
As a kid, I killed two adults, Im too advanced
I lived my twenties at two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told, Im like eighty-seven
Wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
From a distance, dont know which one is a Christian, damn
Who can I trust in 2012? theres no one, not even myself
A Gemini screaming for help, somebody
Hol up , hol up 
Hol up , hol up 
Yeah, big shit poppin, everybody watchin
When you do it like this, nigga, losing aint a option
Hol up , hol up 
Hol up , hol up 
Yeah, big shit poppin
Ayy, ayy, kick her out the studio, Ali
24/7, nigga working his ass for it, she poppin that ass for
The King of Diamonds with diamonds, I never do ask for it
They checkin my passport, Im too accustomed with customs
You callin the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff him
They want me to fast forward the game, and
Why you complain when you niggas is past poor?
Youll never hop in my lane when you pushing a RAV4
You wrecking my Jaguar
You play like a bad sport
Her feet on the dashboard
Hol up , hol up 
Hol up , hol up 
Yeah, big shit poppin, everybody watchin
When you do it like this, nigga, losing aint an option
Hol up , hol up 
Hol up , hol up 
Yeah, big shit poppin, everybody watchin
When you do it like this, nigga
I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
Theyll probably think Im Osama
The plane emergency landed, it was an honor
Hol up
Gather round
Im glad everybody came out tonight
As we stand on our neighborhood corner

Listen

Fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life
Yall be calling it hip-hop, I be calling it hypnotize
Yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body, but freed my mind
What the fuck are you fighting for? Aint nobody gon win that war
My details be retail, man, I got so much in store
Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
Fuck that, nigga, look at that line, its so diverse
They gettin off work and they wanna see Kendrick
Everybody cant drive Benzes, and I been there, so I make it my business
To give em my full attention, ten-hut, man, I gotta get my wind up
Man, I gotta get down with God cause I got my sins up, ooh
Matter fact, dont mistake me for no fuckin rapper
They sit backstage and hide behind them fuckin cameras
I mosh pit, had a microphone and I tossed it
Had a brain, then I lost it
Im out of my mind, so dont you mind how much the cost is
Penny for my thoughts, everybody, please hold up your wallets
Yeah, man, Im the mailman, cant you tell, man?
Gone postal, never freeze up when I approach you
Thats starstruck and roast you, oh my
HiiiPower
Reporting live from Planet Terminator X
I saw Martin Luther King with an AK-47
Now, I dont give a fuck if you
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That dont mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga
Im tired of yall, cause everybody lied to yall
And you believe it? Recognize them false achievements
Its treason and Im Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off
Knock on the doors of opportunity, Im too involved
Im no activist, Im no Einstein
Before calculus, I was kicking that math
Dropping that science like an alchemist and I be kicking that ass
Lyrically, Im UFC
If a UFO had came for me, Ima come back with the head of an alien
Dont alienate my dreams
Get it right, get a life, I got two
Thats a metaphor for the big shit I do
Boy, TMI, TSA, man, Im fly
Put wings on my back
That a plane or an angel? Both
Like a pilot with a halo, woah
Gross
I mean, Ive seen so many things come through them, him, her, you, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Im just a messenger
Yeah, I know lifes a bitch, get the best of her
Put them threes up, they notice that we up
HiiiPower and the power in the people and if they dont believe us
Theyll die
Wizard
Now, I dont give a fuck if you
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That dont mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga
Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is King Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics wouldve told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend its a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning
They raid your spot while Kendricks performing
And if they take everything, know I got
Compton, Compton
Aint no city quite like mine
Ay, Dre whats happening wit it, my nigga?
Still Im at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still Im laughing at the critics talking, I can see em gagging
When Im back in the back of my city, back in the bach
With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where Im at
Its the murder cap and Im captain at birthing this gangsta rap
Its a wrap when Im done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil in a day, bitch Im from
Compton, Compton
Aint no city quite like mine
So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Wont you spend a weekend on Rosecrans, nigga?
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans, nigga
Kendrick Conan, nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
Im trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats
Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the Eastside
Know thats just how Compton roll
And thats a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course thats my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, Im sure its bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in
Compton, Compton
Aint no city quite like mine
So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, Ima take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted thats what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-Eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now Im on the redeye
Flying back to my city cuz Ill forever standby
Compton, Compton
Aint no city quite like mine
Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of N.W.A
America target our rap market, as controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich
And the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers
That know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rosé
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
Look whos responsible
For taking Compton international

Ayo Just Blaze, good looking homie
Just Blaze

Seven figures for a headline
You want some stage time? We can talk about it
Niggas actin like they be rappin
Like nice on the mic, truly doubt it
Go against the kid, yall dont wanna live
That decision is hella childish
Rose gold for my old hoes
They aint satisfied then I sit em down
10th grade, I gave her all shade
But now she got some ass, I wan hit it now
I dont lease, I just all out feast
I put a blue Caprice on Gary Coleman
Bomb head and some cheese eggs
Thats a new raise and a signing bonus
Fall in this bitch
Like some good pussy—cant stand myself
So good, she so hood
She a cheesehead, patty melt
GED with some EBTs, and some DVDs
That shit was happening
She reel me in with some chicken wings
And some collard greens, that shit was brackin
Just cracked me a new bitch
Bust a new nut on her niggas jersey
My bitch get off at nine oclock
So I had to shake her round 7:30
105, Im stomping fast
With these big guns, Im hella dirty
Get caught with this shit
I aint comin home til like 2030
I got big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit gon be death of me 
Big problems, I must admit it
Man, that shit gon be death of me 
Big dreams, no superstition
Man, that shit gon be death of me 
I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope
I cant stand myself
I just bought a new coat, I might go broke
I cant stand myself
I just might ban myself
I just might, God
Im focused, feeling blessed
Cause my eyes be the truth
Im focused, feeling blessed
Cause my eyes be the truth
Mental window blurry as a bitch
Still lookin out it
So much money off the fuckin books
Could write a book about it
Took a minute, no, wait a minute
Let me think about it
Bout ten years, Crips, Bloods
Sweat and tears, and we still counting
Had a real thick bitch named Brooklyn
She fucked the whole squad
Now every time I land in Brooklyn
They fuck with the whole squad
Im more spiritual than lyrical
Im similar to Eli
Why? Cause Im wearin black shades
And Im headed west with the word of God 
Yeah, I think Im finally ready to talk about it
These niggas just talk about it
Homie dont play me for no fool
Poppin bottles like enemigos
Os dios mio, Im so cold
Get so deep in that water, water
They should call my johnson a harpoon
Feed the needy, dont know graffiti
Paint her walls like a cartoon
Beat the pussy up so bad
Send her home with some war wounds
Loaded off the gnac, hit her from the back
Goin cross her head, bar stool
Touch her soul, til I curl her toes
Then its time to reload, then its part two
Damn near thirty, still set trippin, cuz
Where you from? Ima see about it
Last year I made ten million
Thats where Ive been, yeah, a private island
Smoking something, on autopilot
Got too many cars, I might crash a whip
New Rari pedal barely tapping
Nigga, vroom-vroom, yeah, Im rich, bitch
Got two rollies, but one missing
Think my daughter flossing, she in kindergarten
Got one crib worth two cribs
And my front lawn, yeah, thats water fountain
You be talking boss, saying big words
Like philosophies, man, you weird homie
What it sounds to me that you broke as fuck
And your bitch gon leave, and thats real, homie
I got big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit gon be death of me 
Big problems, I must admit it
Man, that shit gon be death of me 
Big dreams, no superstition
That shit gon be the death of me 
I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope
I cant stand myself
I just bought a new coat, I just might go broke
I cant stand myself
I just might damn myself
I just might, God
God
So Im saying, What up? What up? Nigga, you made it
So Im saying, What up? What up? Nigga, you made it
So Im saying, What up? What up? Nigga, you made it
So Im saying, What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it
So Im saying, What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it
Frustrated and Im riding down them back streets
Making my conscience ask me
Will I survive to make it up out this hole in time?
Black boy fly, black boy fly
Black, black boy fly, black boy fly
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym, we was living in sorrow
Total envy of him, he made his dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
His way up outta Compton with further more to accomplish
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
Its 2004 and Im watching him score thirty
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes, heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didnt have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal, meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
Eleven graders gone wrong
He focused on the NBA, we focused on some Patron
Now watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy
I used to be jealous of Jayceon
I used to be jealous of Jayceon Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
Wars the case and just in case you wasnt alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
Its 2004 and Im hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game, they line in front of the store
Swap meets, selling our mixtapes, Im like, Oh shit, wait
Dont wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion, I was defending my insecurities
Chillin my conscience next to a villain
Compton made you believe success wasnt real
Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
So as I peel through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
So watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy
My mama didnt raise me up to be jealous-hearted
Like most of the winners call it
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
Thats what she said, but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
Award touring the country with money from mic recording
The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like Top 40
And shortly, I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner, had them guns bursting
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
That only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces, you just a typical homie
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They allll buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle?
When two niggas making it out had never sounded logical?
Three niggas making it out? Thats mission impossible
So I never believed the type of performance that I could do
I wasnt jealous cause of the talents they got
I was terrified theyd be the last black boys to fly out of Compton
Thank God
Ali, you thirsty on Twitter!
You boo-boo, you Td
You turned down, you thirsty
You boo-boo!
Uh, Im tryna learn something new
Im tryna find myself, Im searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the key to my blessings, and if I speak the good
Into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
Money flow like water, Ill just wait at the dock
And by the way Ima start, finding more light to shed
Like a small garage in your backyard
Im back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
Always hollering who she dont like and who she kick it with
Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
Who Dooney and Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
To the car she drove last year or who fucking on who
And who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
But before your negative energy curve, bitch Ima cut you off
Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... hoe
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say...
Uh, Im tryna learn something new
Im tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
Or at least inquire similar desires
To do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P
Im talking ideas, motivation
Its more than making, enemies, my nigga
Oh, thats not ya memo? Then tell me why you constant stressing
On how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga
I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
Every second tell me how you pressed em at the Monte Cristo
Where so and so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
Who baby mommas a rat, and who got killed last weekend
That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
Speak on somethin with some substance that can get us both paid
Rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
Or his rims aint bigger, pussy nigga, Ima cut you off
Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... scary ass
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say
Uh, Im tryna learn something new
Im tryna better my chances of becoming a star
Im tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa
Studying art... now paint that picture
Life behind bars, remember the very day I got caught?
I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
See what I was taught, family is all I need
But indeed them too can run me right up a tree
Constantly talking shit bout the next relative
Wanting me to take sides, but Id never give in
Ever since grandma died, everyone parted ways
Argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
For 15 years, no one paid him attention but moms
Yeah, my momma as loyal as any sister would come
Come to my house just to yap about your own people
Dang, and if your blood wasnt running through my veins
I would prolly cut yall off too, yep
Cause everytime yall come around
Yall be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God, shut the fuck up
Keep it running, Ali
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say
So tell em, Shut the fuck up!
Tell em, Shut the fuck up!
Yeah, bitch, you boo-boo, you Td
You turnt down, you thirsty
Tell em Shut the fuck up!
Tell em Shut the fuck up!
Yeah, nigga, you boo-boo, you Td
You turnt down, you thirsty
You thirsty, you boo-boo
You T, you turnt down
You boo-boo, you Td
You boo-boo, you turnt down
You thirsty, you Td
You boo-boo, you turnt down
You boo-boo, you Td
You turnt down, you weak
You weak, yo’ bitch weak
Yo- 
You boo-boo, you T 
Keep all that
What is HiiiPoWeR?
HiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live
See it’s known today that the human race is nothing
No morals, no standards
What we’re about to do is raise the level of expectations
No, you don’t have to have a lot of money
You don’t have to be rich
But you will be rich in mind and spirit
Some say it’s as big as a crew, some say it’s as big as a gang
HiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it’s as big as a religion
If Michael Jackson came alive right now
Hed ask you to smoke one for him
So in his honor
You niggas Spud Webb, coming up short
Think youre Dee Brown, jump if you want
I put it on my momma and her very last nerve
Ricky Madoff everything I deserve
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
Do the math, Im a motherfucking G nigga
Its all on me now, as you can see now
Im gon get this money and I will not be denied
Been shittin on you fucks a long time, time to pee now
When you finish first they hate you worse, startin to see now
Im at the round table, where your seat at?
Where your plate, where your lobster, where your sea bass?
We aint never left, acting like we back
You should see us now taking pictures acting like we rap
This the circle thatll murk you, blackout, short circuit
Somebody show them square ass niggas the first exit
This here reserved for soldiers most definitely
So watch what you say and where you step more carefully
If I fall in the field and aint no more air for me
Pour some on the ground and put one in the air for me
Tell my enemies fuck em, they know already but fuck em
Tell em again with a middle finger and a chuckle
You dont know nann nigga, nope, uh uh
This famous thatll still throw copper
Cross so heavy crack the tabernacle
Fire the ganja back up
Throw some blow in my tobacco
Then crank the Lac up
One match left, this the last turn
Santeria candles in my sanctuary burn
Imma earn til the last court adjourn
Til the last gavel drop we gon have it locked
We gon have it locked
We gon have it locked
Im part of the small percentage of niggas who make it out the ghetto
But niggas tried to pull me back cause misery loves company
Its funny how they come for me when they see me living comfortably
But when I was broke and sleeping on floors they aint want nothing from me
My futures so bright but my past so ugly
And I just try to correct it all but it all still haunts me
Tried to section off the past but it still haunts me
So I accept what got me here, reflecting in this rocking chair
All this space created, all that hard work it got me here
So what I look like telling a nigga that I shouldnt be here
Power to the people so the people shouldnt live in fear
And Ill be that raising voice and tell the people treat us fair
Warring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there
Out in the open all alone, I felt the coldest air
Secluded in my thoughts in fear
No one to talk to, no one there
Not even a voice, not even an ear
No one alive, no one to care
Now I got a power circle, now Im on a power trip
And they calling me counterfeit cause I aint gave a coward shit
Stone me, throw me a pile of shit but you wont pull me out of it
Its funny how it comes full circle
Now they wanna be a part of the power circle
They wanna be a part of the power circle
May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in your past
May the kids take all your good
And your wife have class
And you realize your goals
And whats life without grind
Those niggas, yo niggas?
Hope those niggas real as mine
May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in your past
May the kids take all your good
And your wife have class
And you realize your goals
And whats life without grind
Those niggas, yo niggas?
Hope those niggas real as mine
Theres a difference between underrated and hasnt made it
Once you successful they relentlessly giving you hatred
Theres no applause for ya and success is hard for ya
Theres enemies, envy, with green my niggas -- lawnmower
And Im on tour, Jordan 4s, Tom Ford
And I aint thugging, they clapping at me, a encore
Got a dark heart, bright mind, make women crazy
I give her D, I throw up two, I call that shit a safety
Shit is crazy when entertainment aint entertaining
And my inner sanctum need real estate Im out my cabeza
Jealousys for the weak, you aint happy I made it
I be feeling like brother Malcolm just out of the Nation
Allah got us cause if we hollered a lost numbers
I seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggas grandmothers
So shut the fuck up and listen, fuck all them stuck up musicians
My circle small but regardless, my circumference official
My clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage
They gon blitz us but aint no way that they gon hit us
Im so elusive, so my niggas be goin through it
Guess its a wrap when your co-defendant make soul music
Cash rule the world -- at least it do with girls
At least it do with churches, seek the truth and true it hurts
If they real, then they real -- my niggas deserve it
And we dont deal with weak squares in this power circle
We dont deal with weak squares in this power circle
Im like welcome to the power circle
I came a long way, I started with a powdered circle
Clique full of real niggas thatll probably murk you
Cause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal
Lotta talking, lotta Tweeting, til you hear that chopper speaking
Kill my dog, I kill your dog, we tied even, Id believe it
If you see it then you got it, nigga never give up
Cause if you grindin you gon be rich before you can look up
My cousin Knock told me never teach niggas to cook up
Cause you can sell em hard for the low and give em the hookup
And still make the profit
The streets say Im the hottest and a nigga still modest
Im just being honest
Back to the wall, never let em get behind us
Mac in my draws fitting right in my designers
Look at my persona, I dreamed it, woke up and conquered
And there was commas after commas, I eat em like Benihanas
Put the shrimp over the pasta, the pasta over the lobster
And the lobster over the table, power circle a mafia
Just talkin money, talkin money what you talkin bout?
Probably talkin bout us, we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about
Look inside the eyes of the last Mohicans survived
You wont last a weekend outside
Seen a pastor tweaking, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
Later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
See a demon dont compromise
And so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
Im a diamond inside the rough thats too mighty for maricons
I might as well put all my killers in YSL
Put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggas through hell
Hells fire, I never lie, you will never grind
I know the priors they running by us when we do crime
I know that section eight wanna discontinue my Moms
When they heard that Ohio State gave me 30 racks in July
Oh Lord, this cant be life, no it cant be life
When they day breaks and you earned them stripes
And you learned that strike
From upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
Its good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
Now your fate can record it denied a reporter replied
The death rate will eventually climb, so eventually Im
On a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
So about face if it aint business, I get offended, I mind
Now one fake, Im a realist in strive, Im a billion in five
Well a billion cause the limit is the sky and I live on cloud nine
And I recognize my nemesis gon try to put a finish in my shine
But pussy, well hurt you
Life in the power circle
Regardless of how it goes down
Life goes on, am I right?
Tried to warn you niggas
I tried to warn you niggas
Its too late now
Double M-G
Too much cake
Too much power
Too much respect
Bow down, nigga
Ugh!
Back when I first grabbed that pen
I told myself I was gon win
And I aint know when
But it was gon end up happenin, I want in
So you can take your top 5 list
Dead or alive, and put me after Em
Im a fuckin genius
Grippin my fuckin penis, livin this life
You cant tell me nothin
Still aint really got no money, fuckin right
Im all about that real, about that real
This aint no motion picture
I tell you how that feel, how that feel
Even when the odds against you
They wanna see me wearin Polo drawers
Put two chains on, and that aint wrong
But that aint me, I go too damn hard
I dont need clothes or jewelry to stand out
Black lip nigga with his hair wild, too damn proud
Been killin this since Cam made Oh Boy
Oh boy, Im the man now
TDE, put the money in my hand, aint shit free
This business is quick sand and I wont sink
Put the pistol in my hand and I wont think
Blat, blat, blat! Rest in peace
You just made room for the next to be
I never been afraid to say what I wanna say
When I wanna say it, okay then
Furthermore, we do this for yall
Rap is stressin, but it pays great
That is, until you lose appeal
And your release date get date raped
Stay safe, hold your head
I got two fish and a loaf of bread
Feed the people food for thought
‘Cause we all equal, whod have thought?
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
You can have all my shine, Ill give you the light
You can have all my shine, Ill give you the light
I used to wanna rap like Jay Z
Now I feel I could run laps round Jay Z
Nas aint seen nothin this nasty
BIG and Pac got it comin when I pass, too
You got the mic? I aint the one you wanna pass to
My niggas say my new shit past due
I paid dues, even got that shit tattooed
HiiiPower on another plateau
I know you know we need a few plaques too
The brand new niggas with a attitude
Poppin in Compton or Timbuktu
I might even sell my new shit for ten bucks too
Too ill when I jot these words, true eel when I shock the world
I know lifes a bitch
When you know lifes a bitch, then thats not your girl
Cold shit, Im hot though, like coal get, Ab-Soul
This is a shift in paradigm
I remember when I couldnt spare a dime
Now I step in with a pair of dimes, on Ps, yall know me
Flow like water, admiralty, the best author ever to breathe
And as we proceed to follow these dreams, I aint losin no sleep
No-no on them NoDoz, just know no if its no dough
So high, but Im Soulo, two cups and I sip slow
Takin my time, we dont just shine, we illuminate the whole show
Now lets go!
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
You can have all my shine, Ill give you the light
You can have all my shine, Ill give you the light
Time and time, I drop line for line but only time will tell
If I ever go Columbine and cop thirty 9s and cock back and kill
See, the truth is they wanna know
How close me, Dre, and Snoop is
Or how the shoe fits when they choose this
To beat 2Pac, but truth, I give two shits
Bout expectations or critics hatin
Shit, I just put Moms on vacation
Bitch, you never know my new location, its across nations
Court cases get thrown out
So tell the mothafuckin king dethrone now
I am ruler, I am highness, the Prince Zamunda
I am the shit like what the prune does
Black on black tint like Kinte Kunta
Black is back, bitch, Im kin to Kunta
Black-on-black crime resent the shooter
Blat, blat, blat! I intend to mute ya
Racks on racks, I dont rap on tracks
Without my A-game, so please dont ask me about no pressure
Bitch, with the grip of my fingertip I can hold this coast together
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
You can have all my shine, Ill give you the light
You can have all my shine, Ill give you the light
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow
And this I know
I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my drum
Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular, Im drunk
How come I can make them popular, pop em when I want
See Im livin with anxiety, duckin the sobriety
Fuckin up the system, I aint fuckin with society
Justice aint free, therefore justice aint me
So I justify his name on obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God
Now Im thinkin to myself, hollow tips is all I got
Now Im drinkin by myself, at the intersection, parked
Watch you when you walk inside your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your fuckin door and blowin out
Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms
Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain, Im gone
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
He drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippin the handle
Lit off Henny, Im tryna dismantle
These wicked ways, Ive engaged in such a gamble
Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait
Thats a bit ambitious maybe Im trippin
Maybe Im crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension
Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance
Its such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
Studied the son of God and still dont recognize my flaws
I guess Im lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
I pray my experience helps you
As for me Im tryna sort it out
Searching for loopholes in my bruised soul
But who knows?
I just need a little space to breathe
I know perception is key, so I am king
The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
The borderline between insanity is Father Time
I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that Im blind
I know that Im intelligent, my confidence just died
Carpe diem, seize the day, I cant compromise
A tapeworm couldnt cure this gluttonous appetite
A couple trinkets, they seein me as I pacify
But couldnt fathom the meaning of seein sacrifice
Im passin lives on the daily, maybe Im losing faith
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
Professional dream killers reason why Im awake
Im sleepwalkin, Im street stalkin, Im outta place
Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes
Before I blink, do I see me before them pearly gates?
Or this is just a mirage or a facade
Wait
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people
Im inspired, so get inspired
And so he said Why you gotta be so kind-hearted?
Why you couldnt be a con artist? Why you couldnt?
Why you couldnt be mischievous or just a lil devious
The moment that we first started?
Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil time?
Why you let me use yours cus I dont got mine?
Why you always lift me up, when Im completely giving up
Or when niggas holla, Whats up? you give a dry response?
Why you giving me your last knowing you aint got it?
Why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
Why you tell me that you love me, Why you always thinking of me
Want my company rather than going club hopping?
Why you treating my momma like she your momma too?
Why you making promises that youll forever do?
Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you 
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it aint fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there
And so she said Why you gotta be so mean to me?
Why you dont know what you mean to me?
Why you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed
Out in public curse me out and make a scenery?
Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me?
Why text messages popping up saying, Hi, Daddy?
Why you treat me like Im nothing? Why you always at a function?
I be wanting to go out but you don’t ever ask me
Why you slip and say her name when we having sex?
Why you always assuming that I still like my ex?
Every time we get into it, Im the one thats feeling stupid
You dont need me, you gon leave me, thats ya favorite threat
Why you never know how it feel to be lonely?
Why I feel Im the last option after ya homies?
Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go
Even tho you get violent and put your hands on me? 
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it aint fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there
She says she loves me
She says she loves me
So she clings to me, even when I want to be left alone
But shes beautiful
Like, sometimes, when I have things on my mind, shes the perfect person to listen
And she only gives advice, she says, when I give her a cue
She says she loves me
Like when I wake up in the morning, shes sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me
She says she needs me
She says she loves me
Or like when Im stepping out of the shower, shes standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off
She says, she says she loves me
So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
She says she loves me... and I dont know about love
I’ll tell you what I don’t believe in, can I do that? All right, I don’t believe in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever. I try not to obey them at anytime. Thats what I believe in not believing in.
So what keeps you alive?
Four big bottles of water a day, two packs of Marlboro Reds. And, uh, I don’t - what keeps me alive, shit. Music, I have to listen to music all day long. Id say that keeps me going. I’m a pretty dark person, I’ve thought about ending it a million times. And I have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing.
Thank you
Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
Right now, freestyle or write down, whatever
It stillll come up clever, I just need to free my thoughts
And Lord knows that I know better, but I aint perfect
I aint seen too many churches or know them testament verses
You should either hear me now or go deaf
Or end up dead, die trying and know death
Might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath
Fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect, nigga
I mean that from the bottom of my heart
You see my art is all I have
And victory tastes sweet, even when the enemy can throw salt
Still knock them out the park like a fucking tow car
Let bygones be bygones, but where Im from
We buy guns and more guns to give to the young
Im living the life of a nigga trapped, nigga
Inside the system all you envision is trap niggas
My uncle doing life inside prison; he wasnt wrapped too tight
He told me Rap about life, not rap niggas
Thats why Im shaking my head when you rap-dissin
My stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching
I start evaluating, then my final intuition
Is that you wishing a come up, would just come up
We used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse
Niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre
And this is Comp-ton, lions in the land of the triumph
Wrap-Saran our defiance, ban our alliance
Put burners in the hands of the black man
One hood with 20 four-fours like a cloned Kobe Bryant
You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am
You probably even listened to Faith, and think I know Zion
But really Im just caught in the loop, of understanding the truth
Because it seem like its always clashing with science
I got a big fear of flying
My future so bright Id probably go blind before I blink twice
I aint lying
I swear to God, half of yall just dont know Kendrick
The school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance
You walking down the block, he got shot, you are no eye witness
You just mind your business
You just turn your head, kneel down and then tie your tennis
Its kind of scary, aint it?
You cant act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous
Just let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless
Cause your pops wasnt anxious to see you and you hate it
So much you probably had your burner tucked at graduation
So if you see him on em bleachers then you kill him
Facing 25 to life with a murder charge
Your enemies was the prey and now you pray to God
I pray these bars get farther than Compton
And if our record never break, I still won’t break my promise
I promise to keep it honest
Secret society, all we ask is trust
And all we lack is communication like service sucks
The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come
And Im like, The Kendrick Lamar OD in less than a month, all right?
Gotta keep it pushing
Cant let the government tell me how my future looking
Im on Rosecrans and Central trying to duck the central bookins
If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know Im bookin
Never will I surrender
I been a warrior when I came out my moms placenta
In the gutter lane like Im Master Splinter
How splendid, I guess my project had did it
Got all these niggas approaching they mixtapes different
They said seven tracks, I said 15
Called it an EP, they said I’m trippin
But little did they know, I’m tryna change the rules
That we’ve been confined to, so the corporate won’t make decisions
Uppity bitches handling business
Killing our dreams, stealing our vision
Out in Haiti, adolescents barely have a home
In LA everybody think they fucking on
Hop on Twitter, perpetrate we doing big shit
Who we hanging with and bragging about the iPhone
I swear to God most of yall cats just don’t know Kendrick
You barely know yourself, so I guess most of yall should be offended
Ain’t doing this for my health, I’m tryna purchase my momma dem Benzes
Occupying my time with riches, justifying my time ambitions
Just to coincide, just to go inside, plus we idolize why we living
Look, the mastermind took the masters mind
Just the perfect time, just to master mine
Just to match the grind with precision
Look, the mastermind took - 
We would like to call this an appreciation tape for those who recognized the Kendrick Lamar EP. For this is the Kendrick Lamar OD. Because of you we are Overly Dedicated
Uh, close your eyes
So watch her do the Macarena, somewhere out by Pasadena
Love a drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
You a waster of the space that you take up
Livin, this time around Im not kiddin
I had an intuition bout these women and suspicion
Got me lookin at shit different, how a man in my position
Cant start slippin down these slopes cause its all just downhill from there
As a kid I didnt learn that, but now Im aware
When you a youngin you just tryna live your life and have some fun in
A world where you have yet to see how evil its become
Its hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits so I keep em in my lungs
Im a Beatle to these young kids
But sometimes I be feelin like a needle to these young kids
You had the world, you bout to leave it to these young kids
And we gon show you what the love is...
Stay high
Go for what you know
Let it in your mental
And dont ever let it go
It wont stop!
You cant fight the feeling
Feeling
You cant fight the feeling, no
It wont stop!
You cant fight the feeling
Feeling
You cant fight the feeling, no
Uh
And I keep a couple Most Dope homies by me
So there aint too many times its me, myself and Irene
We stay smokin through the night, wake up, do some tai-chi
Homie, cant you see Im chillin? Please dont fuck up my chi
Yeah, my jacket Y-3, recently been up on fashion
Waste a bunch of money, kinda stinks of satisfaction
Fell asleep at Hollywood, woke up in Manhattan
Ballin like Im Jordan, but Im fresh as Mars Blackmon
A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams
A price on a idea, we never can agree
They tell you what to know, but its better to believe
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be?
Still I tell em, Fuck what you know, Im feelin comfortable
Just continue livin life, cause enough of em dont
You spent your days countin every single penny made
Restart now, cause we comin for you anyways
Stay high
Go for what you know 
Let it in your mental 
And dont ever let it go
It aint never gon stop, cause
You cant fight the feeling
 Feeling
You cant fight the feeling, no
Uh, I told you it wont stop, cause
You cant fight the feeling
Feeling
You cant fight the feeling, no
Sometimes I wake up, up in the morning, make her
Wrap this much make-up off my bed, soon as shes yawnin, take up
Hours upon days just to find power shit to say
But you wont hear it even if your ears was pierced with Beats by Dre, I mean
The sun is slowly fallin, we all surely should die eventually
So whats your calling? Oh, you left your phone behind?
Identity crisis, break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us and Devil said you owe ten percent
Sold your soul, I know, sold your soul and youre hopeless
My focus, stare at elopin on boats that float in the open of oceans
That coast the line on the margins I rhyme, you chokin or soakin up game
Im hopin you picked the second one, shame
The emotion of jealousy that youre holdin, youre tellin me
That youre golden but really cubic zirconia, let me see
Ill break you down like a pound of fire, whenever
Your tactics are mighty clever but even if youre Mayweather you
You cant fight the feeling
Feeling
You cant fight the feeling, no
It wont stop!
You cant fight the feeling
Feeling
You cant fight the feeling, no
Fuck me
I want you to fuck me 
I want you to fuck me 
Oh, fuck
Oh, fuck
Oh, fuck
Dont stop
Stop
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
I used to want to see the penitentiary way after elementary
Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalized
My intuition had said I was suited for family ties
My mama is stressin, my daddy tired
I need me a weapon, these niggas ride
Every minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me
How Im gon listen when I dont even hear God?
Heaven or hell, base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty, you worried bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that kill with youll squeal with you
I deal with you like my son, stare at the sun
And youll be looking in my eyes, homie
Stand for something or fall for anything
And you working with two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway, this for my niggas
Uncles, twenty-three hours, sendin me pictures
I want you to know that Im so determined to blow
That you hear the music I wrote, hope it get you off death row
You came home to a pocket full of stones
A Metro PC phone, then you went back in
So when I touch the pen, the pen is in my view
Ima get it right, just so you
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gon have to come and get me
If it feel good to you, holler if you hear me
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that kill with youll squeal with you
I like to start it out from the bottom and build with you
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with you
Im twenty-three with morals and plans of living cordial
Not rich, but wealthy, theres nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful
The city got my back, and for that, I give them my torso
You think about it and dont call me lyrical
Cause really Im just a nigga thats evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worrisome individuals that live life critical
So wont you bear witness while I bare feet?
So you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
But anyway, this for my pops
On his lunch break eating in that parking lot
On Wanna Be Heard, probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me gettin what I deserve
Somebody said my name on the radio
He aint know I was ready for the world that minute
So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it
He probably be out of work, laid back, while he
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gon have to come and get me
If it feel good to you, holler if you hear me

Apply yourself to supply your wealth
Only limitations youll ever have are those that you place upon yourself
Church is definitely on the move, you know what Im talking bout?
Exercise your ism, and dont depend on no one else
Cathedral, church, ism

But when it need air, let it out in a safe lil place

Yeah, roll me some kush I dont want no purp

This is a world premiere!
This is a world premiere!
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
Satan wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water dont go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
And I love myself
I love myself
I love myself
I love my... self
Everybody lookin at you crazy 
What you gonna do? 
Lift up your head and keep moving 
Or let the paranoia haunt you ?
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this
I love myself
I love myself
I love myself
I love my... self
They wanna say its a war outside and a bomb in the street
And a gun in the hood, and a mob of police
And a rock on the corner, and a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean, and a model on the scene, yup
These days of frustration keep yall on tuck and rotation
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of realitys peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
The sky could fall down, the wind could cry now
The strong in me, I still smile
I love myself
I love myself
I love myself
I love my... self
Walk my bare feet 
Down, down valley deep 
Fi-fie-fo-fum 
My heart undone 
The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs
But it can do what it want whenever it want, I dont mind
He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide
One day at a time, sun gonna shine
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, dont nobody call a medic
Ima do it till I get it right
I went to war last night
Ive been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin every other blessin, I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And its evident Im moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body in the street
Keep my money in the ceiling, let my mama know Im free
Give my story to the children and a lesson they can read
And the glory to the feeling of the holy unseen
Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, I love myself!
I lost my head
I mustve misread what the good book said
Oh, woes keep me, its a jungle inside
Give myself again til the well runs dry
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru
I cant recall the last time I took, advice from anyone
Shaped like a figure eight, who trusts pretty girls anyway?
And I cant recall the last time I took advice from anyone
Im sure Ill be the death of me
And I cant recall the last time I took love from anyone
I called daddy, whos got one anyway? Not me
Are you hating yourself? Do you really hate me?
Are you hating yourself?
Was it worth it? Would you do it again?
Arent you tired always making amends? Oh
I know you hate me now 
I bet you hate me now 
Bring on the thorny crown 
Crucify me
Cross my heart then I hope to die
With a peace of mind 
Piece together my brain
Soon as this beat rewind 
Nitrogen and propane
I spike your drink at times 
I make it hard to swallow this game
You throw up every line 
I notice people got Napoleon complexes
Thats my confession 
You said that were equal but I know youre beyond guessing
That Im beyond desperate 
6AM on a Friday morning, my darkest hours
Them heartless hours, my apartment is lost in a coffin
Im dead to the world like I popped me a couple downers
Down & Out on my luck
Salt water all on my tux and I call, she dont pick up
Then I fall when summer is ending
I mean, theres no pretending
Im stuck in my ways and youre offended, thats life
Thats you, this me, that vice
Youre wrong, Im right, thats right
I belong somewhere on ice
Im cold, and my new blood type?
Even colder, cold shoulder
Born Sinner, you know? Cole showed us!
I have nothing to lose
My dark side been well in-tuned
A Gemini gon show them faces
And this here just one of my moods, Babylon
Was it worth it? Would you do it again?
Arent you tired of always making amends?
I know you hate me now 
I bet you hate me now 
Bring on the thorny crown 
Crucify me
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru
Im really over the cryin thing, wipin my tears
Who cries anyway? Spread like disease all over me
We did ungodly ghastly things, last night I mean
Whos God anyway? Youre mine any day
Its burning, take me
I wanna feel your power, this final hour, tell me
Are you losing yourself? Will you lose it for me?
Are you losing yourself?
Was it worth it? Would you do it again?
Arent you tired of always making amends?
I know you hate me now 
I bet you hate me now 
Bring on the thorny crown 
Crucify me
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru

Turn me up a little bit more nigga

There we go yeah, turn me up
Picture plenty pussies throwing pellet guns at me
Paranoia make it more than difficult for me to sleep
Pinnacle, I know I be, centerfold, I know I got
But they hate to frame me as the Mona Lisa of hip-hop
So retaliation is a must, when we bend the block
My niggas dumpn out the roof, 
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put TNT inside my suit
Walk inside the label, struck a match, and then I blew, bomb
C4 everywhere, C4 everywhere
I got three whores with me, it smells like Dior and derrière
Decoys die slow, you can detour to Heavens stairs
Or walk inside Hells dungeon, I just might derail something
They pussies, I smell something
You douche on the daily, niggas, you pushin up daisy
I push the gas on the Mercedes, nigga
Came in this game with a Rolie chain, and a dream
Became reality, made some casualties, my choppers scream
And now we dumpn out the roof, 
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew

Nigga that thought Good Kid gon flop, or that I might go pop
Or your bitch wont drop, knees when my shit drop
Yall too infatuated with the fucking numbers
Which make it easy for me to divide and conquer
I come from Compton, we aint have it all
Smokers basing inside the cafeteria hall
And Im putting fear in you all, see your skeletons shaking
Jump out your body, you Ricky Bobby until you naked
Yall pray to God this week I be putting out bombs
I pray to God this beat is good enough for Shyne
If not J. Cole, your shit is trash
But at least my opinion just made everyone laugh
This is where we at? I guess its entertainment
I guess this is speculation making a classic came with
If I aint have the patience Id probably self destruct
Real people want real music, the jig is up
Your worst fear is confirmed
We love that you crashed and burned
The real is back
K. Dot its your turn, take your victory lap
King Cole salutin Comptons own King Kendrick
Thats the sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
The city hail King Kendrick Lamar
The world hail King Kendrick Lamar
And now we dumpn out the roof, 
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew

Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too

This is my life and I look at it like its my last
And Im lookin right past the future as I reminisce on my past
And I dont even think how I used to, my mind is on rocket blast
And I dont even drink like I used too, and I dont even smoke
So you know this natural flow is for users that want to go to rehab
Lookin at the coke that he had, matter fact that followers bother them
Then but I wont say my bad, see I just lay in the cut
Watch the product stack up, motherfucker what what
See now we dumpn out the roof
You niggas don’t even know
All that talk then no show
Cannot tell me nothin
Show me somethin I aint seen before
That hoe want my piccolo
Smoking on that mistletoe
Make her kiss all on it
While we chop chop on them 24s
She look like a centerfold
Mouth all on my genitals
Suckin on it like she gettin vitamins and minerals
I be on the chemicals, she be on my testicles
Poke her with my tentacle then put her out my schedules
Rolling up them vegetables
Rapping with that special flow
Only way youre next to blow if you be strapped with C4
I be fresh from head to toe, every day a fashion show
Used to tote that Calico and serve like John McEnroe
Now I sell out all my shows
Used to sell out all my blow
That was back when we was coppin dubs to try and roll up 4
Now a nigga livin good

When youre getting money, nigga, every day is sunny

Second grade, took my mama weddin ring, took that bitch
To show-and-tell, now Im married to the game to no avail
Grounded me for like a month, now Im gettin high as fuck
Employer tryna write me up, but now Im a writer
With ambitions of a rider, and half the shit on my rider I dont even want, the Fantas for us, the Hennys for the sluts 
Givenchy bikers with the rev rips
Balmain badmon, Bathing Ape on my dick
Paid by the Bloods, raised by the Crips
Soulo Ho3 the prophecies, atrocities, exhibition
Oh yeah, now a nigga livin good
But good could be better I wish a motherfucker would

Life is like an appetite of truth and dare, I double dare ya
Life to end in vain before the end is near
See I can hear you crying
Silence sittin in the dark
Holdin crosses cross your heart
Sin is such a work of art
Watch out for the love lost
Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand
Things a nigga do for thousands
Made a million counting sheep
Gave it all to public housin
Taking off to Abu Dhabi
Beamin up the motor, Scotty
Talking to promoters, Scotty
Everybody know its Gotti
Murder one, youve heard of them
The rev undid, the all day madness
Got it off the wipe it off, the evidence, the blood on mattress
Big power, big stages
My zoo cannot fit the cages
This booth is not used to fakin
My crew just love confrontation
I chewed the face off the laces
I moved the weight from the waitress
I chef the pot that made poison
I cooked then kicked all the patients
My bitch is way beyond basic
Thats life insurance, car insurance, good pussy insurance
Ayy, look what were enduring
Ayy, ridin in foreigns
Ayy, K-Dot, four years, I got the same watch
But its the real watch and that bitch fire
Speed Racer waitin outside

And I never pass my mama no blunt
And kept my head straight

Look, I just broke up with my bitch cause we aint argue enough

Health and wealth, goin deep for it, do right for my next life
Let me get some too

And head to the ground when I walk in school
Goin through the motions, mad impulsive
Granny, I wont abide by the rules
I shall reside with advisers to boom
Fuck that, Booman, let me get some too
Life aint always about your name in they mouth
And the cars and the clothes and the jewels

Shake his hand, then jump back in that minivan
Double back to his block and blam
I aint backing down for nothing
Ima back em down like Shaq
With this black 2-2-3 in my hand
Better pray that this chopper jam like a radio single, man
Police radio signals saying that a 187 land on your corner
Coroners comfort your momma
Momma, hes dead, the next morning
I toasted up with my homies
We drink and smoke marijuana
Want us to change our ways? Uh-huh
You see this game we play come from
Uncles that raised me in Compton
Ask me what I have accomplished
I dont know, I dont have conscience
I just load up and start dumping on enemies
Im headhuntin, no sympathy
Aint no love when you in these streets
Just get something, protect your neck
Cause they coming for sets, respect
Split your onion, then chop your deck
Your head tumbling like gymnastics 
Cause ignorance is bliss
Now everybody put your hands up high
If you dont give a fuck, put your hands up high
This the hardest shit youve heard from LA this far
And Im this far from a discharge, but never will I diss yall
We all tryna ball, and when I got the rock, Ill dish off
Until the day I pistol-whip you posers til yall pissed off
Then peel off in a hoopty
Come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me
And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
Indubitably, Im too street—indubitably, Ima do me
Better than your bitch would, cause you niggas too weak
But just give me two weeks and Im good
Ill make an album thatll put a smile on Malcolm
Make Martin Luther tell God Im the future for Heavens talent
No tarot card reading; Im foreseeing you niggas vanish
Not only from the rap game—Im including the planet
Cats so watered-down, clowns can sink Titanic
Tie titanium around their neck and watch em panic
Give me respect, dammit, or get damaged
Die young, corpse identified by your parents
Apparently, youre a parrot, mocking me and my blueprint
But I wont share it, just make you cop it, then call you a sheriff
Stop it, Im hearin the comments
The critics are calling me conscious
But truthfully, every shooter be callin me Compton
So truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common?
Proves... that ignorance is bliss
Now everybody put your hands up high
If you dont give a fuck, put your hands up high
And this still the hardest shit youve heard from LA this far
And Im this far, from a discharge, but never will I diss yall
This my world, I grab the universe then play kickball
And they wonder why these California earthquakes hittin so hard
Im So-Cal, you so-called rappers need to go call Ghostbusters
Cause you busters are Casper when I go off
I show up to show out and show off
You a hundred percent behind me
And if you are, then wreck your car
And walk up to my crime scene
I remember bein seventeen, wishin someone would sign me
Now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
Backin down bargains, backin down bitches
We gon flip her
Once she off that blue dolphin, you gon tip her
Cause ignorance is bliss
And Willie B, Im a fool on your beats
I bleed out the speaker as the speaker that spoke when they didnt speak
We on?
Aight
1,2,3, go!
Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace til you hear people scream
Your name in unison, Im so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like Im supposed to be here
Everywhere I go Im getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they cant wait for the LP
And Im gonna blow
They believe in me
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
Thats why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am
Im so high I can touch the sky
I know its my time
And its now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, aint nothing better
A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted
To the earth cause the people that hurt can understand it
You speakin outlandish
Imma show you how to make it all work
Another planet, its a short term goal for me
A record sold for me
Its just more of me in your ear
For you to hear Kendrick persevere
Defenses I feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin off I aint takin off these Pistons
Im takin off on the inner me - youre distance
Came across me, how much ita cost me
To get you out my business
I said a planet is a short term goal, no sky is the limit
Im past that, now pass that
Award, not one but four
Times two plus yours
I see myself performing there, 
Sold out shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammys winning five awards
See myself on big billboards
Traveling around the world with endorsement deals
Cant imagine how it feels
Thats why Im smiling everyday
Because my dream aint far away
Im so high I can touch the sky
I know its my time
And its now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, aint nothing better
You looking at me and you tell me Im blessed
Calculated my steps, my heart, my breath
Breathe in lungs of a victory and vividly
You see me when at my best, my worst
This verse dedicated to the days that I slept
With a curse research my paid dues Im reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
Im a King on the prowl and I see mama smile?
And I vow on the tape that Ill never break
You can break bread with me now
We can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal
Then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue
And walked that mile
In the darkness I often sit back
And get lost in the rap that I wrote
When you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talking to you
I was walking it through every ghetto
Tell success hello
We here
And Im so happy I cry
Cause I cant believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And its so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you pray so hard
And youve come so far
And you know that its the time for you to lift your bar
And Im gonna do it
Watch me!
Im so high I can touch the sky
I know its my time
And its now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, aint nothing better
Im so high I can touch the sky
I know its my time
And its now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, aint nothing better
Where you from nigga?
What is going on in Compton? I dont understand it.
Well as it relates to this, this is not in my field as the clerk so anything that relates to this, youll probably have to get an answer from Dr. Dre.
I heard you talking about respect, I gave you niggas the utmost
All you niggas the utmost
Would you look over Picassos shoulder
And tell him about his brush strokes?
Them opinions, I dont trust those
I apologize, the city made a nigga so cutthroat
Every hood love me, but it started on one coast
Couldve stopped in 86 but I knew that you would want more
Im on the throne in a place some niggas wont go
 Been away from home
But I aint been gone that long
(All they wanna know is: where you from? Where you from?
Where you from, nigga, huh? Compton!)
Psst! This is about where Im from
I think its time to take these niggas to the deep water
Yeah, down in the Pacific , representin
Where them sharks at nigga, down in the deep water
Listen, listen, listen, all you niggas swimming in the info
Go fuck around and drown in the specifics
Always going overboard, used to be my kinfolk
Now you sleeping with the motherfuckin fishes
These niggas wont let up until they all wet up
 Naw, nigga!
Now everybody wanna visit tryna re-up that prescription
Thats my nigga, watercolors couldnt even paint the picture
If they dont get the picture, fuck them
Yeah, drugs by the dozen
You might just wanna go and check the children
Im the one that got they ear
Ah, for many years, I been making parents live in fear
I just wanna make it clear: My influence run deep like the ocean
 Been away from home
But I aint been gone that long
(All they wanna know is: where you from? Where you from?
Where you from, nigga, huh? Compton!)
Feels like youre drowning, dont you?
About a hundred miles down in that ocean
Its over, shoulda never jumped in
If you cant swim 
Oh my God, wheres a lifeguard when you need one?
Motherfucker know I started from the bottom, vodka baby bottle
Mixin that with Similac, my momma knew I had a problem
Wasnt thinking bout no rapping, I was juuging for a dollar
Putting quarter pieces in the black Caprice and make it holla
No policing me, I got the beast in me, I gotta holla
Keep the decency and make them TNT my product
Im a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator, energizer
Inner city bullet flyin til that bitch on auto pilot
Ah, shit! I dont give a fuck about your whereabouts
All I care about is wearing out your area
And airing out your upper body
When I catch ya walking out your parents house
 Homie got fucked up
Tryna park his tour bus, not knowing whats what
Or whos who, living in the L.A. County zoo
Pick them off like a big dog, motherfucker, woof!
Once upon a time, I shot a nigga on accident 
I tried to kill him but I guess I needed more practicing 
Thats when I realized banging wasnt for everybody
Switch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me
They liable to bury him, they nominated six to carry him
They worry him to death, but hes no vegetarian
The beef is on his breath, inheriting the drama better than
A great white, nigga, this is life in my aquarium
 Been away from home
Been away from home all night long
(All they wanna know is: where you from?
Where you from, nigga, huh? Compton)
This is about where Im from
I think its time to take these niggas to the deep water
Yeah, down in the Pacific
Where them sharks at, nigga, down in the deep water
Help me
Im drowning
Help me, help me, help me
Somebody help me
(Shoulda never jumped in
If you, if you cant swim)
Help me
Help me, help me, help me
I cant, I cant breathe
I cant breathe, help
God, please, please help me, please
Please help me, please help...
Please help, please, please...
La, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la

Tried to give her up but she fuck so well
Man, that bitch so cold, man, that bitch so cold
Ima take my time, Ima hit that slow
Cause I aint in a rush young girl
You the only thing for me in this fucked up world
And do you believe in love?
Hold on tight when demons come
Itll be alright, no need to run
Stay with me tonight, well see the sun
And when we wake up early well still be young
Never felt this free before, I need you more
Than keys need doors, I need you sleepin next to me
The blanket sheets, Ill take them all and keep you warm 
And I teach her that we were the creatures of love
You be the leader, I could be Julius Caesar
When Im pullin up in the Bimmer
The beats in the trunk, all the freaks wanna fuck
Hearts on my timeline
Bullet to your rose, then I watch your petal fold
Dont you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know

Girl, you so lonely
Will you come home with me?
Just take your clothes off, babe

I love it when you tell me that you dont behave
Tell me when and where, I bet I wont be late
All I really wanna do is procreate
Im a Superman, youll be my Lois Lane

We gon keep on goin til our bones both break

Hearts on my timeline
Bullet to your rose, then I watch your petal fold
Dont you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know
Sexy, nasty 
Have no guideline 
One day, four times
You dont mind that
I dont care
God is fair
Hello, I would like to tell you about my love affair with my husband and the wonderful ways that we were able to understand each other, and find out about each other. We got to know each other little by little, living very close in the same building, and he would help me with things, and I would see him and think what a cute guy, and he was a cute guy. And it was just little by little, we got to know just to say hello. One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody, he knew, people he worked with all adored him. And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody, for me was the most important. Being attracted to him and being... finding people respected him and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time...
So, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys. And...my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys, and I feel I just gave him a wonderful life. A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too. And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other.
I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl, thats fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?
No makeup today, no makeup today, today
No makeup today, no makeup today
And girl, thats fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?
I know she bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful and how long it took
For you to put it on, it was early in the morn
She resembled a model out of a MAC book
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
Of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on her skin tone
Her complexion in a direction Ive outgrown
Damn girl, why so much?
You bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Dont you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing?
From Heaven is where you got it from
I love your smile, you can do it without style
From your lips all the way to your eyebrows
Its the beauty in her, but when the makeup occur
I dont see it, all I see is a blur
I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl, thats fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?
No makeup today, no makeup today, today
No makeup today, no makeup today
And girl, thats fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?
I know she bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful and how long it took
For you to put it on, it was early in the morn
She resembled a model out of a MAC book
Concentrating on the way my eyeliner thickens
He stand behind me and try to figure her vision
Of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on my skin tone
My complexion in a direction Ive outgrown
I feel like its not enough
I can never put on too much makeup
Yeah, I know your imperfections, I be constantly stressing
From him is where I get it from, they tell me I need to
Smile at least once in a while
I hate my lips, my nose, my eyebrows
Its the beauty in me, but what he dont see
Is that I had a black eye— to be continued, eleven
Ladies and gentlemen
And you aint gotta get drunk to have fun
You aint gotta get drunk to have fun
And you aint gotta get drunk to have fun
You aint gotta get drunk to have fun
I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl, thats fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?
No makeup today, no makeup today, today
No makeup today, no makeup today
And girl, thats fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?
This what you really want, huh?
Turn me up, Ali
I know your image of me
Is what I hope to be
Black lip bastard, pass me your password
So I can hack inside your brain
See, I too have gone insane
Before I fall Im sure to curse you all in Jesus name
Lead shower, Anna Peebles hour, bitch stand the rain
This what yall really want
Let me get it back Ali
When we do- when we do interviews, dont ask me bout no movements
Yeah Im good
No crews, no-no posses, no cliques
If it aint bout TDE I dont wanna hear that shit, bitch
Look inside my parkin garage and see a collage
Of every person I despised since the moment I turned five
Calculate my steps and strategically took my time
Even fallin off, I land on the ass of Nicki Minaj 
Eat that pink pussy like its Friday
Bust one, roam and reload, then smoke to Sade
And somebody tell Rihanna too
I need that vagina too 
Dont fuckin take me for some kind of fool
Im kinda the reminder of knowin Compton aint kinda cool
Good kid, mad city, mountaintops couldnt see my views
Countertops, we hop over, hit the register, then we move
I hope this shit can register on a regular soon
Before I climb this pedestal
And make you catch my fuckin stool 
K.Dot, leave em grievin on evenin news
Even when society break even, Ill break rules
I told niggas, caught wrecked, then I towed niggas
Fold niggas like clothes and drawers, nigga
Homie chose to go toe-to-toe, I had to break his leg
Like a cliché to rock a show, is that over your head?
Niggas stretchin the truth like they choose to do yoga instead
Either that or they depressed, eatin yogurt in bed
Solar system, grab a space shuttle and stay subtle
The bass bit the bait, Im straight, you a gay couple
I aint thirsty for the deal, wait and make em pay double
Im anxious, when the bacon on the table, I need a muzzle
Youre basic like cable to a satellite dish
You was runnin L.A., now you out of there like Fish
What more can I say? Im a bastard with black lips
Black shirt, black shades, long black dick
Im awkward, dog, Im tryna bargain shop at Saks Fifth
Swung two axes and knocked the Earth off axis, ask em
And all we do is it, all we do is do it
All we do is do it, all we do is do it 
All we do is do it
And all we do is it, all we do is do it
All we do is do it, all we do is do it 
(This what you want, I give up
Let Puff Daddy talk to you
The real Puff Daddy)
Figg side, black nine, black lips, smoke time
Fuck this rap shit, Im active
Suckin on titties since I was eight
Hoodie with my shades, I aint tryna be fake
So dont be talkin to me, pussy
Runnin your gums like you be Locing
When the world know that youre nookie
Rookie, softer than infant fabric, I wont have it
When the gun drawn, get rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tatted
Know my niggas movin
You hesitatin to hit the lick, what the fuck is you doin?
Perpetratin, bitches poppin Percocet and percolatin
Freelance for God but do the work of Satan
Whatever works
Im clever with the words if you havent noticed yet
Lightyears ahead, Im bright and I like to get oral sex
Soul brother number one plus one
Gettin fed like where drugs and guns come from
All we do is do it, shittin on the competition
Takin heads off, this Hannibal Lecter music
You niggas dont move me, you niggas just movies
Cut straight to them credits and hit you with a Uzi
Peel off in a dullies, truck bed full of toolies
Get home, smoke, poke on some coochie
Im just fuckin around, enough with them fairy tales
But I bust heads for real, go head—
Im Jay Rock, you lil niggas beneath me
How you gon dance with the devil with two left feet?
Peep, thinkin you sweet, but you weak
Talkin out of turnll leave all of your teeth in the street
Mama taught you better, never clash with a giant
Unless you David, remember, my nigga, Im not Goliath
Feel the wrath of this titan
Hit some water, call it Poseidon
Wig out, then hit your ass with a trident
Money on the table my nigga, you know Im all in
If rap was a drink, you wine, nigga Im all gin
Hundred proof, recruit a hundred troops who love to shoot
No fluke, my nigga, you know thats what us hunters do
East side up, Watts City mayhem
Choppers, they sprayin from AM to PM
Im the silent assassin of the four-headed dragon
Black Hippy blastin a .50 out the back of the Benz Wagon
Toe-taggin wack rappers off G.P
You cant see me, your vision aint 3D
You smokin on that seaweed, we rollin up that kiwi
And the Backwood lighted, we high for like three weeks
You payin for that pussy, but we always get freebies
Top Dawg that ho and throw it like a frisbee, its history
You know the night and day is ours
Top Dawg conglomerate, Hiii Power, bitch
Is this what yall really want?
This Black Hippy shit what yall really want?
When Im in interviews, dont ask me bout no crews
No posses, no cliques, dont tell me whos gettin it
I dont give a fuck, nigga
I just paid— I just paid six figures in taxes, nigga
Off Section.80, on some independent shit
Uncle Sam talkin bout, you an old lost relative, nigga fuck you
K-Dot said it, not Kendrick
Ab-Soul the rawest motherfucker on the planet, nigga
T.D.E., solar system, Control System, beyotch
Come here, girl
Oh, you want me to touch you right there?
Oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair
Oh you want it? Oh you want it right now
Like that? I got you baby
All on you baby
Push it back on daddy
Push it back on daddy baby
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory, life is...
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory
Life no longer infinity this was the final calling
No birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking
We all nervous and crying, moving in caution
In disbeliefs our beliefs the reason for all this
The tallest building plummet, cracking, and crumbling
The ground is shaking, swallowing young woman
With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
The smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable
Preachers touching on boys run for cover, the paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into dust
Famous screaming in agony
Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling hes alive
Backpedaling Christians settling for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tides out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom, college classrooms been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
 no more running from world wars
 no more discriminating the poor
 no more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure
I swore I seen it vividly
A moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony
Thunder like number four, then I heard
What have you did for me
I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
That dated back to June 17th, 1987
My paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes, pray to God that I live forever
Dark skies, fire and brimstone, some of us sent home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
Geez Louise, I thought you said that I excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly for you
Told me to use my vocals to save mankind for you
Say I didnt try for you, say I didnt ride for you
I tithed for you, I pushed the club to the side for you
Who love you like I love you?
Crucifix, tell me you can fix
Anytime I need, Ima start jotting everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me
Always camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
I guess Im running in place trying to make it to church
Young nigga act an ass
Young nigga act a fool
Young nigga get yo cash
Young nigga do what it do
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch
Just take it all back before the light switch
Most of them gon talk, I know, I know
Most of them gon fall, I know, I know
We gon bet it all, I know-oh-oh-oh
We gon bet it all, I know-oh

Dust me off and show me all truth

Show me how you do it like that
Carryin a brother is no easy on your back

Hourglass, yeah, she turned it over
Power girl, yeah, shes over the city
Hourglass, yeah, she turned it over
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience
And youre relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the Fifth Amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow
Wait a minute!
Now, why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
Intuition got a broke bitch wishin
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it
Bitches dont prosper chasing education
But youre talented, and cant handle it
And your homegirls cant be your manager
365 times four, plus more
If you cant get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But shit, aint no money like fast money
Even today Im considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them
Why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby 
You know the poverty stricken the little broke born babies 
Somebody yell Kendrick American, they sho’ is crazy
And I said “why?”
Then he looked me in the eye, and said nigga you fucked up
You’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
You never been through shit, you’re crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain’t shit, I live in a hut bitch
Im living to keep warm, you living to pay rent
I prayed my way through by waiting on Allah
You played your way through, by living in sci-fi
Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When yall came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope
These days ain’t no compromise
And your pain ain’t mines half the time
A brand new excuse ain’t shit to me
Bitch, I made my moves, with shackled feet
Cape Town
In todays day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them, him and her
But when a blessing takes too long, thats when you go wrong
You selfish motherfucker
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
Pimp pimp
Wait
King of my city, king of my country, king of my homeland
King of the filthy, king of the fallen, we livin again
King of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin
King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watchin
King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed
King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect
King of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it
King of the winners district and geniuses with conviction
King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated
King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken
King of the empathy, your resentment, king of remorse
King of my enemies, may they fall defeat, I rejoice
King of the skyscrapers, dodgin haters, broke religion
Nine faces, go against em, I erased em with precision
I embrace them with collision, kings did it
Kings vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick, all hail the king!
I dropped a million tears
I know several responsibilities put me here
I dont pedal backwards, but I live old-fashioned
The lens that Im lookin through
Wont prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free
Ashes Im dumpin out, bout to spread all cross seas
Sisters and brothers in unison, not because of me
Because we dont glue with the opposition, we glue with peace
But stilld fuck up your organization if any beef
What do you stand for?
Are you a activist? What are your city plans for?
Are you a accident? Are you just in the way?
Your native tongue contradictin what your body language say
Are you a king or you jokin? Are you a king or you posin?
Are you a king or you smokin bowl rocks to keep you open?
Because the king dont cry, king dont die
King dont lie, king give all, king get by, king dont fall
Kingdom come, when I come, you know why
KING! KING! KING! KING! KING!
I am TChalla
Whats your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon live on your knees or die on your feet?
Its fire in the street, fire in my Swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your lil sister
Just get a sip of this elixir
Before they crop us out the picture
Ive never seen a crop circle
But I seen cops circle the block
I puff squares, but I swear, one day, Ima stop
My nerves itch
On the brink of my career
While my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear these screams?
One, two, three, four grams and a fifth of Hennessy
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary
Section 80s babies, blame Ronald Reagan
We raising hell, hell 
Lord forbid, the homies got wet, so we trying to soak it in
The president is Black, but you cant vote for skin
You vote for the better man
Come to our show, you could see the diversity
Unify the people, they gon peep it universally
We might not change the world
But we gon manipulate it, I hope you participatin
Ayo, Dot, wont you let these cats know?
We knew wed be here, like, back in 04
Started HiiiPower because our generation needed a generator
In a system meant to disintegrate us 
And all we do is assist them
Were not victors, were victims
The bigger picture isnt developed yet
Like, what if Keisha was celibate?
Or what if Tammy came across a real man
Who didnt play games like children?
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend
With his girlfriends girlfriend, let the world end
And everybody tripping off 2012
And the extraterrestrial presence as well
 But our future is not
That martial law shit drop, we gon all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat your fast food, use your fluoride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public, work your lil nine to five
Dont forget to pay your tithes and thank God youre alive
HiiiPower
And on another note
We focused like the Hubble Telescope
Soul
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam
Life...
I wrote this because I was ordered to
People say I speak for generation Y
Why lie? I do, Section.80
Your sonll play me if radio wont
Daughters that just turn one til twenty-one listen to Kendrick
For instance
Whats your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon live on your knees or die on your feet?
Take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree
And do exactly what you see on TV
True story
Hmm
Can you repeat that for me, Soul?
Whats your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon live on your knees or die on your feet?
Is you gon plead the fifth or sound the horn?
The time is now, my child, come on
See, a lot of yall dont understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
You know what all them things have in common?
Only half of the truth, if you tell it
See I spent twenty-three years on this earth searching for answers
Til one day I realized I had to come up with my own
Im not on the outside looking in
Im not on the inside looking out
Im in the dead fucking center, looking around
You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?
Thats an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So, the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
Just know I meant it, and you felt it
Cause you too are searching for answers
Im not the next pop star, Im not the next socially-aware rapper
I am a human motherfuckin being over dope-ass instrumentation
Kendrick Lamar
Now fuck em up, Terrace
I watch this fire that we’re gathered around
And see that it burns similar to the fire that’s inside you
Section.80
Section.80 babies
A generation of bliss and disobedience
No, they cant control us
No, they cant control you
No, they cant control us
But we can control each other
We build our own world
If you dont leave with nothing else tonight
You will leave with knowing yourself
You will leave knowing that you represent something thats bigger than all of us
Our family
Heart, honor, and respect
This is you
This is me
And we are HiiiPower
These metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what I see
A Gemini, duality personalities always conflicted me
Oh! But dont be scared of me, girl
I can explain
I know its foreign to you
I know its hard to believe
God give me the favor
Let me explain
More than a compliment
And I could use some assistance, let me show you how
I can explain
Oh shando! I spin around two times
Ill be there with the answer
Let me explain
Im bizarre, avant-garde
Both sides of me are evenly odd
Its attractive, youre intrigued
Am I mortal man or make-believe?
Anything you want to know 
I can explain it
Any misunderstandings, baby 
I can explain it
Why dont you sit and talk to me a while? 
Let me explain it, ahh yes 
My mama told me that I was different the moment I was invented
Estranged baby, no Im not ashamed
I recommend every inch of your lunatic ways
Praise the lord, you teach the kids how to be themself and plenty more
You know the male species can be redundant
I mean we love a woman and think we can satisfy her
Between sheets, covers and pillows
Im promising your lack of tolerance stuck on a zero
Im promising that Im acknowledging you as my hero
Cause you believe in me
No youre not easily impressed
But I possess qualities that you need to see
Look at my flaws, look at my flaws
Look at my imperfections in awe
Look how you unique that my mystique is a round of applause
And yours equally valued
You stick out like an alien compared to those around you
And thats alright because I like it
You and me are the same
Hopefully Im invited, hopefully you dont change
Because I know for sure who you are
I can explain
Your mama raised you, your daddy raised you
Hand-washing your clothes on Sunday
Let me explain
Walking your brother to school, three miles away
To feed the mind and soul
I can explain
Dont you explain that, dont you explain the reason why your mind, it travels
Let me explain
I wanna know what you think
I wanna pick your brain when I see you
But dont you ever
Let me explain
Oh shando! I spin around two times
A blessing in disguise
I can explain
I know for sure who you are
Youre the goddess of the odd
I am yours
I can explain
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours
Ndiseza ndingene laduma vumile
Ndiseza ndingene laduma vumile
Check, check, check, check, check
It go ride to it, ride to it, cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Dont do it like he did, cause he aint what you is
But we can win, wait, lets get straight to the point
To the meaning of life, whats my purpose?
Maybe this Earth is aint a good place to be
How far is heaven? Lets see
Is it in the clouds like they said it would be?
I wonder when I die will he give me receipts?
I wonder will the eyes of the Lord look at me?
Look at me, look at me, Im a loser, Im a winner
Im good, Im bad, Im a Christian, Im a sinner
Im humble, Im loud, Im righteous, Im a killer
What Im doing? Im saying that Im human, now people just
Ride to it, ride to it, cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Dont do it like he did, cause he aint what you is
But we can win, wait, lets get straight to the point
It go one , two , three 
Two in the front, one in the back seat 
Seat , seat , seat 
Looking for a victim of a AK-47, hundred-round each, each, each
But why must we retaliate? Is it human nature?
I dont know, I look for the answers later
Make a right, there they go 
Sometimes gotta
Ride to it, ride to it, cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Dont do it like he did, cause he aint what you is
But we can win-win, wait, lets get straight to the point
As I open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
My plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
Im dying inside, I wonder if Zion inside the heavens
A condom, a Rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a MAC-11
Thats all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right
But Im right on the edge of Everest and I might jump tonight
Have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinners advice?
Well its probably you, am I right? If Im wrong, you a fucking liar
When I lie on my back and look at the ceiling, its so appealing to pray
I wonder if Im just a villain, dealing my morals away
Some people look at my face then tell me dont worry bout it
I give em back they deposit, no money, just total silence
Im running, they say Im wildin, a youngin with lack of guidance
Thats hundreds of us with problems
Mo money, mo drugs and violence
Look at the soul of an out-of-control artist
Thats dealing with life the hardest, thats on my life
But regardless Ima—
Ride to it, ride to it, cause I never know
When a bullet might hit me and I die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live my life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Dont do it like he did, cause he aint what I is
But we can win, wait, lets get straight to the point
Hmm
Yeah, life can please ya, but death can tease ya
On the day Niko had that seizure
I lost one of my biggest believers, aww
Close deaths make you think about your life
Like if I had that same chance twice, what would I do different?
Id tell her I loved her more, do more
But tease her bout crying on that picture
Now when Im done recording
Swear, I let the beat bang in her name
Make her shake her head in heaven, saying, They at it again
Make them clouds turn to speakers
Dont take too much smoke from the reefer
Love being in the room with her peoples
Now my love life murking it, family having surgeries
Hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me
Lord, what kind of life is this?
Momma, I just wanna sing
Momma said, According to get everything 
You gotta risk everything
So Im smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians 
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians

Two tears in a bucket, I cry with you, agh!
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight, I freeze up when I re-up
See, I barely have patience, and youre relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it? Went to work for it
See, a nine-to-five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came, checks didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth, I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all, but if I can shortcut my success
Corvettes by tomorrow, ugh!
Why so sad? Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have, blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell em color me bad, blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down
My homegirl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
Intuition got a Black woman wishin
She saying this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh, the anticipation, hoping you could make it
Women dont prosper chasin education
But youre talented, and cant handle it
And your homegirls cant be your manager
365 times four, plus more
Cant get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But aint no money like fast money
Even today, Im considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them
But why Im so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have, blue faces 
I hit the bank today and tell em, color me bad, blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down, to the top
I love God, I love speed
I love drank, I love mead
I love oceans in the deep
I love women, I love me
I love God
Ugh! But I’m scared of godspeeeeeeed
Sometimes
I wrote this song
Looking at a broke home, maybe 
You know the poverty-stricken
The little broke boy and babies 
Somebody say Kendrick American, they sho’ is crazy
And I said “Why?”
Then he looked me in the eye
And said Homie, youre messed up
You’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
Never been through ish, you’re crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
YSay you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain’t it, I live in a hut
Youre living to keep warm, Im living to pay rent
I paid my way through, praying to Allah
You played your way through, dealing with wi-fi
Bull-ishing yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing go for the ones you came with
We all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope, huh?
These days ain’t no compromise, ugh
Your pain ain’t mines half the time, ugh
A brand new excuse ain’t nothing to me
See, I made my moves with shackled feet
Cape Town, Cape Town
Cape Town, Cape Town
Caaaaaaaaape Town
Cape Town, Cape Town
Ugh!
Cornrow Kenny
All morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrrt!
Morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrrt-skrrt!
Cornrow Kenny
So many plays on me, I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I react
Me and Top is like a Kobe-and-Phil
A father figure; play with him, you get killed
Play with me and he-a kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juugin’ like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juugin’ like that
I did a lot of dumb things in my past
Lord forgive me, hoping I dont relapse
Dave just bought a new 9-11
Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Me, Im about to let my hair down to hoes
Ali bout to let his hair down to hoes
Top billing, that’s a million a show
Might blow the whole no-whammy on Soul
Might tell Obama, Be more like Punch
Sounwave got a Grammy this year
Mackwop, bet he do what he want
Level two, level two, no, I’m not done
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
I could put a rapper on life support
Guaranteed, something that none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
Ward is like twenty-five hundred a month
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t got, you ain’t got
You ain’t got, you ain’t got
Tell me that, tell me that that Im the one
You ain’t got, you ain’t got, you ain’t got
You ain’t got tell me that, what! I’m the one
Yes, I’m the one!
Dont judge me
I know this girl, she a real good girl and she be low-key
Looking like a star with a real nice car, a Mercedes key
And she got a nigga and she love this nigga, well, at least I think
Every time we bark, she pay us no mind in the middle of the street
She be like
Fuck them other niggas cause Im down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas cause Im down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, Ill ride for my nigga
Ill die for my nigga, fuck them other—
Until one day, he wasnt acting right
In the middle of the night, she checked his phone, Erica, right?
When he pled the Fifth, man, it was on, matter fact, she gone
Matter fact, Tyrone was on speed dial, so when she got home
It was going down, she go
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other—
I know this girl, she a real hood girl, and she with the shit
Keep her hair tied up, big bamboos, Mike Jordan kicks
With that big butt, but when I try to holla, she gon resist
In her man, she trust, so when I walk by her, she be screaming this
She be like
Fuck them other niggas cause Im down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas cause Im down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, Ill ride for my nigga
Ill die for my nigga, fuck them other—
Until one day, he wasnt acting right
In the middle of the night, she checked his pockets, found condoms by
Magnum, and the moment they was acknowledged, she popped his eye
Then ran outside, then started drivin on the passenger side
Homeboy was smiling, she gon
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other—
And so these girls, these vulnerable girls
Took they men up, put em in they world, they vulnerable world
And just like that, it was only gettin, got they feelings hurt
Tell me how that sound? They got fed up with the biggest question mark
They curious now
Cause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand
To lend each other, uncover emotions when lights dim
So when she telling her to come over, itll be alright
The minute she hit the block and turn left, shell be turning dyke, they go
Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches on the side cause these niggas—
Tammys song
Frustration 
Hesitation 
Come closer baby 
One question: Am I moving too fast?
Cause I aint leaving alone- feel like I could be honest babe
We both know that were grown
Thats why I wanna know
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I dont wanna waste my time
Back of my mind, Im hoping you say two or three
You look good; we came to party
But I dont wanna waste my time
Temptation 
Sweet persuasion, oh 
Come closer baby 
Impassioned 
Cause I aint leaving alone- feel like I could be honest babe
We both know that were grown
Thats why I wanna know
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I dont wanna waste my time
Back of my mind, Im hoping you say two or three
You look good; we came to party
But I dont wanna waste my time
Aha, and what do we have
Your empty heart and my empty bottle and yellow cab
That you are likely to catch cause your latest ex made you mad
So I figured the perfect catch would be you if I made the pass
Pool full of liquor then we dive - in it
Knowing if I lick her I might die - in it
Then reincarnate as a fly - gymnast
Just to flip my tongue on you
This the Olympics
State your name, live in the moment
It’s your time to own it, I see it in you baby
She tell me that she never give the first night away
And life is a bitch, but every dog has its day
Holla pull up, pull up, bring it back, come rewind
Pull up them big trucks, that pack come behind
Pool full of liquor then we die - in it
Pull em to the side, let me slide up in it
Or waste your time, or waste your time
Or waste our time, baby its alright
Baby its alright, baby its alright yeah
Oh its alright now
Alright. Oh yeah
I dont wanna waste my time, no
I dont wanna waste no time, oh no
I dont wanna waste your time, babe
I dont wanna waste our time
Oh my time, Oh whoaaa, now
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me? 
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I dont wanna waste my time 
Back of my mind, Im hoping you say two or three 
You look good; we came to party
But I dont wanna waste my time
No-no-no. I aint judgin if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
What? More power to you if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
I aint judgin if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
What? More power to you if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
Lets go, shit we only live once right?
I mean, wheres the fun in forever anyway?
Where are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now
Where are we going, we should be slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now
That’s what she said to me, that place I used to call home
Is just a bed to me
We don’t even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
Meanwhile I’m in these streets with everybody, I’m trying to get it
And she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me
As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
Look each other in the face and barely blink
I tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
So if my letters don’t reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync
Where are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now
That’s what it said to me, but the place I call ambition
Now dead to me, gone and forgotten, I’m off track
Like Dale Earnhardt, my liver rotten, alcoholic tripping
Fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
Club night, guys and dolls
Balling out but Im bout to drop the ball
I’m calling out for help, my engineer called
Told me come to the studio but I wanna tell him, nah
Where are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now
That’s what he said to me
But that place we call Heavens unfair to me, only 144 can go
Seven billion people on planet Earth today
Is there something that I don’t know
I know to follow Him rather following people
Or follow vanity cause that means I’m following evil
Guess I’m following evil, I should follow cathedral
Blessings I need but live like I don’t need you
Where are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now
So in conclusion
We all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
So to what is important in my life, I apologize
I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
We all get distracted, the question is
Would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
Would you not know how to act or take action?
It’s just a part of life and if your vision’s impaired, you probably lose it all tonight
Tryna visualize how to get it right but my vision’s so blurry
Tryna slow it down, stay close to the ground, but we’re always in a hurry now
And if I could make this world spin a little slower, then I would
Then we could grow a little closer, I think we’re getting closer
I think we’re getting closer
Two-door coupe, hoppin out like Jack-in-the-Box, nigga
Im gon shoot if this 30s all that I got, nigga

Love, lets talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
Tell me what you gon do to me
Confrontation aint nothin new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you cant bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I dont even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy cause I aint invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin?
Motherfucker, I dont even like you
Corrupt a mans heart with a gift
Thats how you find out who you dealin with
A small percentage who Im buildin with
I want the credit if Im losin or Im winnin
On my momma, thats the realest shit
Love, lets talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin like ya involved, like a rebound
Got no end game, got no ways out, got to stay down
Its the way that you making me feel
Like nobody ever loved me like you do, you do
You kinda feeling like youre tryna get away from me
If you do, I wont move
I aint just cry for no reason, I aint just pray for no reason
I give thanks for the days, for the hours
And another way, another life breathin
I did it all cause it feel good
I wouldnt do it at all if it feel bad
Better live your life, were runnin out of time
Love, lets talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

I’m awful antsy, hope that convince you

Keepin it G aint nothin 
You aint gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
You aint gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public 
I got the whole block bumpin 
You aint gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
You aint gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public 
Na na na na now now, you know what this is
Tell em its a celebration, bitches
With the barbeque pits and the mini-bikes
Mini-skirts, Hennessys, and the Miller Lites
Domino tables, who got big 6?
Where Im from we do concrete backflips
Flip flop, flip flop, flip flop back
To the ghettos where I bring hip hop back
Real niggas love me, they tell me Keep it pushin!
The only niggas speak from way inside Central Bookings
County jails and the lock downs up north
Said I should have it if Scarface pass the torch
Thats how they feel, Jack, built much more than rap
This that project haircut in the cul-de-sac
This is where Jose front you them quarters at
Meet your quota whenever I put a quote on a track, nigga
Keepin it G aint nothin 
You aint gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
You aint gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public 
I got the whole block bumpin 
You aint gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
You aint gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public 
From Compton to Baltimore Ima kill it
I buy a morgue in the minute
The public house, the plastic couch of a section 8 tenant
The Regal window is tinted
The air conditioner broke
But Im cool enough to ensure you my ride is an Eskimo
 And I peel off
In the midst of gettin my thrills off
And I thrive off energies from inner cities that we lost 
Im puttin the ghetto on top of my back
And I live in the back of the jungle
Lions, tigers, bears, oh my
Hear the siren, walk up, drive-by
Shooters, looters, federal fed intruders
The engines on back of scooters
The real can recognize real
And we need to know just who you are
You are in the presence of many presents
Kendrick the gift for the future, oh yeah, I said it
Thug life, good kid, mad city
Mad respect representin the hub right
Keepin it G aint nothin 
You aint gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
You aint gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public 
I got the whole block bumpin 
You aint gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
You aint gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public 
The home girls tell me Im the shit
I break em off so they can buy some outfits
I buy they sons a pack of pampers, some new Jordans
Give em the game, school em on whats really important
Its how I was raised, the OGs had me
Thirteen, fresh off the porch, slangin cavi
But Im wiser now, show all my young niggas
Theres other ways you get them dollars and funds, nigga
Comin down in an old school, so cool
Whip like a fire ball; call it Goku
You dont know the tribulations that we go through
Put your ears to the speakers, Ima show you
I paint the picture so perfect
In my CD, you see Mona Lisa in person
Courtesy of a hunnit beat
Got my Crips and esses at arm reach; one West
Keepin it G aint nothin 
You aint gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
You aint gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public 
I got the whole block bumpin 
You aint gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
You aint gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public
Pillars of joy can be found
Through the thought of you
Ill be troubled and bustled and scorned for your love
Canei Finch on the beat
Turn the headphones up, Ali
Here we go
I woke up this morning with my dick on hard
Didnt know why til I said fuck all yall
Or fuck this world, or Imma fuck that girl
Good kid, m.A.A.d city, watch my day unfurl
I put my life in these sentences
Fucking right, its either that or life sentences
Im relatives with Benjamin
I used to give a fuck about my luck when I was innocent
Now what the fuck is up? Im at your neck like a Pendleton
Nigga, I need that, bitch, I need that
Twenty-four acres and a mule, best believe that
They say he got smoke, like where the weed at?
And everything you hope, bitch nigga, we that
Pockets on Kelly Price back when it was 95
Buy a strap and then we cock it back when its uncircumcised
Write a rap on how we just react when shotty hit the spine
Give you dap and then we slide through your hood three dozen times
So whats good? Im looking for a pedicure
Pink pussy that pop, preferably the kind that dont stink
Bomb-ass head til she cant blink
And her eyes get watery, you gotta pardon me
Im so damn turnt
Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
And you know, Westside, right on time, tell em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they dont fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
Westside, right on time, only thing fosho
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door
I woke up this morning like fuck the world
Been hustling since I was twelve, man, Ive been through hell
Now these motherfuckers is trying to tell me I dont care
Trying to tell yall motherfuckers, look, yall wasnt there
Turnt, posted up on the block, waiting for mail
From my niggas posted up in the county, praying for bail
Couldve cost your boy everything, man, it wasnt cheap
Coming for a nigga, just dont sleep, shit for the weak
Got on my Malcolm X frames, now I count the check, mane
Cause every time I speak, you hear my Malcolm X pain
Now them doors go up on that Lamb, they like judo
Young, you like your bitches with ass? I like you, hoe!
First, them bitches see me, Im gone, Im like Pluto
Plus, I keep them choppers that sing, they Mars Bruno
Brown bag full of cash, baby, MCM
When they ask me my name, I tell em MC him, straight up
Im so turnt
Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
And you know, Westside, right on time, tell em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they dont fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
Westside, right on time, only thing fosho
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door
All praise go to the most high
All fades turn into a drive-by
Part ways from the streets, after fucking with police guaranteed
Last nigga did that died, dont you, dont you, dont you
Wanna live where the AK go for only 8K
Minus six racks, minus one on top of that?
Melee, stomp him out then drug him out like a date rape
Daytonas bending every corner while they say
Im so turnt
Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
And you know, Westside, right on time, tell em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they dont fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
Westside, right on time, only thing fosho
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door
All I ever wanted was a dollar bill and hundreds
And my teacher as my woman, when she smiled, I stick my tongue in
Plus some cartoons and some cereal, Snoop Doggy on my stereo
Some British Knights or LA Gears with glowing lights or Perry Ellis jacket
I would love a swapmeet full of Chevrolets in candy paint
Thats wet with Tammy on the bumper, can I hump her? Poppa tell me yes
A DPGC concert and a DJ Quik song on cassette
Twenty years later: hi hater, Im the fucking best
Im so turnt
Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
And you know, Westside, right on time, tell em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they dont fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
Westside, right on time, only thing fosho
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door
I can see the darkness in me and its quite amazing
Life and death is no mystery and I wanna taste it
Step inside of my mind and youll find curiosity, animosity
High philosophy, hyper prophesied meditation
Reminisce on my wonder years and I wonder here
Sentiments of my words aint been so sincere
The sentiment of my nerves that I just persevere
The big thought of fallin off disappeared to my fate
They say that Heavens real
Analyze my demise, I say Im super anxious
Recognize I deprive this feeling and then I embrace it
Vandalizing these walls only if they could talk
Conversations wont contemplate to my dark thoughts
Lookin down on my soul now, tell me Im in control now
Tell me I can live long and I can live wrong and I can live right
And I can sing song and I can unite the you that I love
You that I like, look at my life and tell me I fight
This that final destination, this that find some information
This that find some inspiration, this that crack, the installation
This that quantum jump and that fist pump and that bomb detonation
Please dont bomb my nation, embalming fluid waiting
I got mind control when Im here, you gon hate me when Im gone
Aint no blood pumpin no fear, I got hope inside of my bones
This that life beyond your own life, this aint physical for mankind
This that out-of-body experience, no coincidence you been died
Bitch, youre dead!
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me
Say you will never ever catch me
Say you will never ever
H.O.C., H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
H.O.C., H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
Everybody know I spit that other shit
Shit that make you duck for cover shit
Shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit
Especially when Drop drop the beat
I drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
Jump in the booth and shatter every rappers dream
They jump in a sauna because I killed their self-esteem
Thats a jab, you should bob and weave
Like Pam when Martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
I go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
Cause Im the only nigga there not smoking no herb
You telling me the kush make you think on level four?
Im on five, you saying that I can level more?
In high school, my teachers thought I was smoking stress
Didnt know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
I stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time
Creation of man, and Columbine
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think Im off the kush or the hydro
 I dont even smoke, I dont even smoke
I dont even smoke, I dont even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I dont even smoke, I dont even smoke
I dont even smoke, I dont even smoke
Look, nowadays everybody think theyre big chiefers
Just cause they heard that new tape from Wiz Khalifa
Knowing damn well they cant hit the sour
Theyre new booties, they probably need baby powder
My skill shower over your city for 40 days
40 nights, off the chain, like freedom of slaves
Before you get it twisted, like 40 gays
My flow worth the earth, thats not to be appraised
Those the type of lines that Im talking bout
You know the type of rhymes you dont talk about
Copy my session on a disc when the session ends
So my momma can have it and play it for her friends
Brag on me, like My sons bout to win
Somehow, someday, and I dont care when
I might hit the gin once a month
Ill let you inhale, like an atheist
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think Im off the kush or the hydro
 I dont even smoke, I dont even smoke
I dont even smoke, I dont even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I dont even smoke, I dont even smoke
I dont even smoke, I dont even smoke
Ill take you back to the 9th grade
When Dough Boy had me high for 4 days
Thats my nigga, he a street nigga
Probably in your hood, fucking up your street, nigga
But anyway I think it was some purple
Told me Dont hit it hard because itll hurt you
I didnt listen, I was floating like the Rose Parade
Swear to God a nigga seen some flying fishes
That was the Vegas trip, Hooters sponsored
The same time I start writing like a fucking monster
Im Frankenstein every time this mothafucker ponders
Just underline every letter, capital K-D-O-T
Laying it flat out, like a tire with slow leaks
Now what you bout? Nothing huh
Am I a square cause I dont puff a square?
Are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? Yeah
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think Im off the kush or the hydro
 I dont even smoke, I dont even smoke
I dont even smoke, I dont even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I dont even smoke, I dont even smoke
I dont even smoke, I dont even smoke
H.O.C., H.O.C
All the real smokers give me H.O.C
Bitch sit on my face, I attack that
Choose up, lil junt, Im finna pack him
When it comes to my bitch, Im straight active
Dirtball in the coupe smokin cat piss
Lil bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy
Lil bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy
You know I love it when you talk dirty
Messy, you my orange soda shorty
You act like a lil me, I wanna fuck you
You the type to kill me, I wont touch you
You want me drop a band on some cute shoes?
You want me be the man you can vent to?
You let me beat it up, you let me practice
Now Im finna lay you on the mattress
Bitch sit on my face, I attack that 
Choose up, lil junt, Im finna pack him
When it comes to my bitch, Im straight active
Dirtball in the coupe smokin cat piss
Lil bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy
Lil bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy 
My lil baby low-key a flexer
Six figs on the whip, thats a price tag
Lil best friend bitch tried to press me
Im that underground nigga with the check, though
I hate a bitch that I cant impress
When you come see the crib, you better die, ho
Young nigga sneakin in through your side door
Baby Keem, not a wave, Im a vibe, ho
Seven fig nig with the big drip on me 
Post on your block with your wish list on me
Bitch sit on my face, I attack that
Choose up, lil junt, Im finna pack him
When it comes to my bitch, Im straight active
Dirtball in the coupe smokin cat piss
Lil bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy
Lil bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy
And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recording this, wont you look in the sky?
Tell him that you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stabilitys never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley and peaks, with bare feet
Run through the flames, thats more passion for me
I passed testimony just so the world can see
My battle wounds on me, you watching me lick ‘em clean
I know, I know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows
I know, I know, its mind control
I know I could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by ya, what?
I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote
And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
Im trying to find my way back, theres no day off for heroes
And even when Im tired, go is the only word I know
And the night is takin over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin focus
Aint no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
Ill simply say its on again, its on again, whoa-oh
The world dont stop, its on again, its on again, whoa-oh
I am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness, I sacrifice my ego
There aint no room for selfish, we do it for the people
And the night is takin over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
[When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin focus
Aint no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward]
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
Ill simply say its on again, its on again, whoa-oh
The world dont stop, its on again, its on again, whoa-oh
Say the work dont stop, cause they dont stop
And everybody here tryna get on top
Everybody from the burbs down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and dont let go, let go
Huh, so you think you hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
You can have, or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto, ghetto
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
Ill simply say its on again, its on again, whoa-oh
The world dont stop, its on again, its on again, whoa-oh
Look, my nigga this is dedication, this is anti-hesitation
This a real nigga celebration
This a Dime Blocc declaration
59th and 5th Ave, granny house with vanilla wafers
This the remedy, the separation
2Pac of my generation, blue pill in the fuckin Matrix
Red rose in the gray pavement
Young black nigga trapped and he cant change it
Know he a genius, he just cant claim it
Cause they left him no platforms to explain it
He frustrated so he get faded
But deep down inside he know you cant fade him
How long should I stay dedicated?
How long til opportunity meet preparation?
I need some real nigga reparations
Fore I run up in your bank just for recreation
Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, Im done waitin
Im done waitin, told you that I wasnt playin
Now you hear what I been sayin
Dedication
Its dedication, look
I spent my whole life thinkin out the box
Boxin homies three-on-one, got DPed but I aint drop
Chirp on me, here I come, brrt, spin around the block
They blurped on me, said I ran a stop sign but thats a lie
I spent my whole life starin at the stage
Playin Sega, daddy smokin sherm, mama playin spades
Catchin vapors, grandma said Id get some Jordans for my grades
Thats my baby, when she died my heart broke a hundred ways
I spent my whole life tryna make it, tryna chase it
The cycle of a black man divided, tryna break it
You take a loss? Shit, dont cry about it, just embrace it
Minor setback for major comeback, thats my favorite
My nigga L said, You do a song with Nip, K. Dot, he a better Crip
I said, He a man first, you hear the words out his lips
About flourishing from the streets to black businesses?
Level four, yard livin, given to false imprisonment
Listen close, my nigga
Its bigger than deuces and fours, my nigga
Since elementary we close, my nigga, yeah, straight like that
I give you the game, go back to the turf and give it right back
For generations we been dealt bad hands with bad plans
Prove your dedication by hoppin out Grand Ams
Im at the premiere politickin with Top, Nip, and Snoop
Damn, Pac watchin the way we grew, from dedication
If it aint congratulate then it look like hate
If it aint congratulate then it look like what, Nipsey?
Hol up
Look
This aint entertainment, its for niggas on the slave ship
These songs just the spirituals I swam against them waves with
Ended up on shore to they amazement
Now I hope the example I sets not contagious
Lock us behind gates but cant tame us
Used to be, Stay safe, now its, Stay dangerous
Cause aint no point in playin defense, nigga
Thats why I dove off the deep end, nigga, without a life jacket
Couple mil, tour the world, dawg, my life crackin
Cook the books, bring it back so its no taxes
Royalties, publishing, plus I own masters
Ill be damned if I slave for some white crackers
I was mappin this out, I hit the heist backwards
Hoppin out the eighty-five in Reebok Classics
Ran a couple marathons just to get established
To make it happen, you got to have it
Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, Im done waitin
Im done waitin, told you that I wasnt playin
Now you hear what I been sayin
Dedication
Its dedication
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Momma take this motherfuckin block off
Tryna reach you every day, collect calls
Never get through, and I go through withdrawals
Say who told you that I wanted this door
To slam shut, I just wanted to vent or
Ask you if you give me your rent for
A attorney, I can pay you back more
Soon as I get out, yeah, every rack is yours
Commissary running low, I need help
Not too much, I hustle up the rest myself
K. Dot wrote me saying Marcus got killed
If you knew me, then you know how bad I feel
Quisha prove me wrong, and never came to visit
And I heard she fucking on some other nigga
And my niggas left me in the dark, blind
Mama just get back at me this last time
Men lie, wo- women lie
Men lie, wo- women
Men lie, wo- women lie
Men lie, wo- women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Mama, take this motherfuckin block off
Thats on the date the day I take the block off
Pulled up, and they put me in them cop cars
Please believe me, this aint easy by far
You forgot youre talking to your only son
Member when you put me in that relay run
I was racing, chasing dreams to be the best
You had taught me that the very day I won
All I need is you to give me same support
Investigation saying that the same report
From a witness just might testify in court
DA say I take a deal, or take a loss
I aint built for all them goddamn numbers
Gods will, say a prayer for me mama
If you cant, then open up the phone lines
Mama just get back at me this last time
Men lie, wo- women lie
Men lie, wo- women
Men lie, wo- women lie
Men lie, wo- women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Dante, if I stress to take the block off
Thats the day the state had take them locks off
I could only help but do so much
Bettering yourself, your own crutch
Look at your reflection, tell me who you see
Who is your protection? G-O-D
No, its not neglection, I have just accepted
Your fate and what its gon be
Member all the nights that I cried
Thinkin that my only son just died
Peeking through the window, kickin through the door
Its you they looking for, raid outside
Rather see you locked up than dead
Only you would say that Im selfish
So before I take the stand and put this bible in my hand
Son, let me say this
Men lie, wo- women lie
Men lie, wo- women
Men lie, wo- women lie
Men lie, wo- women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
I been goin silly for the Westside 
You might catch me rollin where the reps ride 
Aint no opposition, Im the best, right? 
I might take my city on a test drive 
You dont wanna see me on a good day 
You dont wanna see me on a bad day 
I was just a nigga with some hoop dreams 
Now, Im in the league, bitch
Now, Im in the lead, bitch
I can slam dunk but I just layup 
Smokin marijuana til I, ooh , what? wake up
May not understand me cause its all real 
And I dont really give a damn how yall feel

Baby, Im just tryna let my hair down 
Everybodys watchin, Im aware now

Baby, Im just tryna let my–
If I take off my cool, do you promise to stay?
If I give you my heart, would you throw it away?
Do you mean what you say when you tell me you love me?
Do you really?
Do you really?
Itty-bitty bitch is a numerologist
Got your number where I live
Ima get you outta pocket like a quarterback blitz
Thats a everyday faucet, make it wet, make it rinse
Skeletons in your closet but your past dont exist
Got a pad on your list, got a pad on your lock
Calabas aint the move, thats where everybody live
Plus the mountain is hot, you forgot what you got, ah!
Hol up, nuisance 
I recommend em all with acoustics 
I recommend a bed for the juices 
I recommend you live where the truth is 
Psychedelic views and infinity pools, yeah, checking out
Once I sweat them edges out
Hair down like vanity
I got the fuck-ups, I got the damage fees
I got the gold dust, I got the anesthesia
When you chose up, this aint a fantasy
We bout to go up, see underhanding me never got no love
But understandin me maybe can mold us and–
Baby, Im just tryna let my hair down 
Baby, Im just tryna let my hair down 
Everybodys watching, Im aware now 
But I cant find a reason I should care now 
Baby, Im just tryna let my–
If I take off my cool, do you promise to stay?
If I give you my heart, would you throw it away?
Do you mean what you say when you tell me you love me?
Do you really?
Do you really?
They say the government mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth
And welfare dont mean well for you, you, you, you
They tell me that my bills past due, due, due, due
And preacher man dont always tell the truth, truth, truth, truth
 head is the answer, head is the future
Dont second guess yourself
Come on give me some help, hey
Head is the answer, do it for the future, girl
Dont second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
And I just wanna
And I just wanna
Straight up
Eyes with my head
And I cant use some help
Straight up
Head is the future
Ayy, K. Dot
Can we get it how we used to get it like when Top had the red Charger?
Can we get it how we used to get it like when Top had the red Charger?
Can we get it how we used to get it?
Cap on, and I got racks on
Spend four nights in a country I like
Then take my rich ass back home
Glow so bright, I could make moonlight
See this aint like your pheromones
Blew one, big gun, baritone
Who won? We won, yeah, holmes
We old school like Capitol
My old school made doctor note
My old school made hard knock
Black on black, my coupe and strap
I aint ballin on the hard top, I told yall to call Top
Now my number call blocked, I dont miss, I call shot
Hold up, yeah, cap on and I got racks on 
And I produce that diesel, I could put Shaq on 
Nigga, your bitch gon leave you, you aint got backbone 
I dont rely on people, I just go and bread chase, whoa
This so fuckin dope, I might catch a fed case, whoa
You aint gettin money, nigga, then you dead weight, whoa

Fuck your feelin, no question bitch, I kill it, I bring that check home
We old school like domino, my old school made lawyers know
My old school a match box, black on black, bad bitch in the back
We ballin on a hard top, Dot told yall to call Top
Now my number call blocked, we dont miss, we call shots
Swervin, I pay em no mind because I curve em
She said I look way better in person
I told her I do better when Im workin
You scared motherfucker? Go to churches
Right back in this bitch, take a flick, ho, whats happenin? Yeah
We dont politic, money clip like its fashion, yeah
Me and Rock go back like flippin mattresses
Me and Dot go back like knockin addresses
Cap on, cap on, drum hold thirty, no add-on
Lil Man-Man not the one to go bad on
Big kickstand fold out when you lack on
You aint no man, you a mouse in a rat hole
I hold band, whole stack, thats factual
Called Big Ten on a island bashful
Fuck your plan, Ima burn that castle
Fuck that clan, Ima burn that task force
Its sick murder when I say go
Hoppin out that van with the black ski mask
And a great big burner when I say go
Man I took my chance in the paint like that
Lets see how further it might go
And it just might hurt you when I go
And my name might curse you when I go, bitch
God, we trust
Fear no man but in God, we trust
Both palm in hand, prayin I stay up
I know you try your best but its not like us, wow
Oh you say you got a bad one? Wow
I can tell you never had one, wow
We back to back actin maney, wow
Eastside Johnny goin stupid, stupid, stupid, wow
One, two, one, two, one two
Mm
One, two, one, two, one two
One, two
Turn the headphones up, Ali
One, two
You mix with Dre, right?
Hehehehehe
Turn the headphones up
When the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated
Thats enough pressure to live your whole life sedated
Find the tallest building in Vegas and jump off it
But I could never rewrite history in a coffin
So Im talking to God: Can you wash all these demons off me?
This last year been quite similar to a Lear
Control my own destiny, only rapper that steered a G5
Gs give high-fives to me and say, Kendrick, just persevere
The presence of being real
As I lay in this four-corner room, staring at candles
Thinking, How can I make an example for this generation of Compton?
My biggest fear is not feeling accomplished
Or turning back to that same accomplice
My past life was a child with no act-right
Tryna smile in a room of killers, turn into a crash site
Influenced by niggas that spoke the gang culture fluent
Assuring that some blossom early and some truant
Thank God for the album I idolized
Its Dark and Plus Hell is Hot—thats the start of this crazy ride
Two young niggas, me and Dave inside the garage
And thought we was Jay and Dame
Thats the lane that we tried to drive
Truthfully, I just started rappin to get away
I never thought that your favorite rapper would want a verse
My nigga got hit 25 times with a K
Make the decision: Ride the beat or ride in a hearse
Now Punch is my mentor, Top Dawg is the coach
Jay Rock is my older brother, I was there when he wrote
His name on his record deal, we had figured the coast
Would live on a pedestal, once the shit hit the store
Found ourselves scrambling, tryna figure it out
Soul told me that the record shop bout to go in a drought
Q aint got a place to stay and bout to sleep on the couch
We eating off each other tray, the dollar-menu amount
Meanwhile, the coast going hard at each other
The younger rappers had wanted some of the OGs comfort
But I aint need it
I never screamed out The New West, I didnt believe it
They brung each other down, I was planning out my achievements, huh
I need to separate myself to stand out, huh
I need a better way to take your fans now, huh
I need to kill you motherfuckers dead 
Three hollow-tips aimed at your head 
Ill be damned if the chopper jam now 
And we never asked for no handout
In the midst of it, all I recall a call when you said how
We could never resolve in the Hall of Fame
And I went to trial with a Bible and rifle
I play the game as I blam-blaow!
Holler back at me, nigga
And if they said that Im the one, why you asking me, nigga?
Cause when the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated
Enough pressure to make you just open the Book of David
And pray to God that you make it or live your life in the Matrix
Cause falling off is a sickness—I heard that its quite contagious
I need to separate myself to stand out, huh
I need a better way to take your fans now, huh
I need to kill you motherfuckers dead
Three hollow-tips aimed at your head
Ill be damned if the chopper jam now
And we never ask for no handouts
Ill take you back to that pack of Black & Milds in my hand now 
In the midst of it all, was cooking, them pots and pans out
Looking forward as four of us forced to form a new clan now
Fast-forward as I wait in line for this passport
The homies was still poor, with work in a Jansport
Whoever thought that Rosenberg would mention me to Dre?
Even Vanessa from XXL had told him press play
And there goes my fate; now, Im on stage with Snoop
Gave me the torch and I ran with it in hot pursuit
Rapped with my forefathers, even wreck it with Gaga, too
Lyricist of the year, fuck am I posed to do? Rock!
Laughing at you niggas out there who thought we was flukes
Exaggerated shit that we rapped had came true
Thought I was aggravated when Warner had let me loose
I was honored—see, they was haunted when Mike Jones didnt recoup
Cool, cause niggas wont outdo us in the booth
Even when my album leak, fans still buy it for proof
I came, I saw, I conquered
No shame, I blame all of this on Compton
Thinking bout when Sherane tried to set me up
Cold game, full circle, they set up her
I put my life in these twelve songs, my fight in these twelve songs
The fight to ignite any wrong and right that I prolong
The story, the short film, the glory of him and them
The worry of mothers that dont recover when babies killed
The trial and the tribulations, the newer Miseducation
The view of a body wasting, you knew somebody who aint make it
The angry, the adolescent, the reason I ask this question:
Will you let hip-hop die on October 22nd?
Will you let hip-hop die on October 22nd?
Where you at? Where you from?
Whatcha doing over here, motherfucker?
Whatcha think? What you bang?
This aint no motherfuckin game
Now I aint never been no gangsta
But I know niggas, know niggas from the darkside
Theres some cold killas, cold killas 
My nigga, you should roll with us, roll with us 
Married to the more money, more women
Now I aint ever been the one thatll pull a gun on you
But I know who got em
No, I never sold no drugs, homie
But I know who got em
And I never had no fucking bullets in me
But I know who got em
Mmmmm, heeeey-heeeeeey
If you die tonight, you die tonight
Momma might cry tonight if she find you high off the dynamite
But to you, well, its just another Friday night
Got a nigga feeling kinda nice
With the Bible right beside that pile of white
Thats what this life is like
Now please dont give me a reason, reason
Cause I know you wanna keep breathing this evening
Ive been killing the game for seasons, believe him
That Im the motherfuckin one to breed them and lead em
In a league of my own
You aint even made it up to my throne
You aint even authorized for this song
Might be best for you to get goin
Best be careful about your tone
That shit can hit me wrong and its on
I have tried my best to be calm
Please dont make me grab that phone 
Now who you know who came this fucking far
From the fucking bottom?
Thirty years in this bitch and Im still here
Decade after decade
And evidently I must be doing somethin right
Word to my nigga Eazy
Eazy-E C-P-T OG from the other side 
From the other side 
Its easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But Its hard for me to believe it
Youll find out when Im gone
I went from hanging out down at the swap meet
To driving some of the hottest cars L.A. has ever seen
People been tellin me Ive grown into some kind of monster
But they dont know me though, Ive been this way since seventeen
Tryna get finances poppin, man, I thought that was the object
Til some of my niggas lost they life and then there goes the team
My only dream was holding it down, like, fuck who tryna stop us
You could get the middle finger or the reddest beam
Its your choice, I took this industry by storm, young and black
Killing them softly
Dont ever call me fortunate, you dont know what it cost me
So anybody complaining about they circumstances lost me, homie
We aint even talkin, fuck that energy, fuck up off me, ugh!
Its easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But Its hard for me to believe it
Youll find out when Im gone
You look at my lifestyle
Im living my life now
Im dealing with diligent Benjamin
How come my attitude piped down?
Im fucking with Ice now
Im fucking with shit that you only can get
On an oversea flight now
You scared of my heights now
But still, I got enemies giving me energy
I wanna fight now
Subliminal, sending me all of this hate
I thought I was holding the mic down
I thought I was holding my city up
I thought I was good in the media
You think Im too hood in my video?
But really, no clue, you idiot
I just cant help myself
Even when that record spin
Every now and then, you hang yourself
Cause I got the green and gold 
Plus plenty more, 
But with or without the diamonds, though
 Im just another 
Its easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But Its hard for me to believe it
Youll find out when Im gone
Youll find out when Im gone
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
Is your house big? Is your car nice?
Is your girl fine? Fuck her all night?
Is you well paid? Are your shows packed?
If your song played, would they know that?
How the thug life? How the love life?
How the workload? Is your buzz right?
Do the trap jump? Is the plug right?
Got your head right? Boy, yeah right
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
Pretty woman wanna slit the wrist
Pretty woman wanna be a rich mans bitch
Pretty women want a couple kids
Pretty women want a new ass, new lips
Pretty women wanna push a Benz
Come correct and she wont let you in
Thumbin through a check, she gets it in
Diamonds on your neck, is them pretend?
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
Got an enemy that changes dependin what direction
Youre facin
Got an enemy that tells you what block and what division
Youre placed in
You pretend to get a better idea about the lifestyle
Youre chasin
Keep pretendin, make it real until every cell replaced, erased
Pop til its vacant

Temporary pimp, nah, dont remember them
Just canary yellow gem, jumping out the fuckin gym
Swang like new Dana Dane, I ride dirty
Paid like two Damon Wayans, retire early
Fade like shadows, the stallion, the cattle
A bitches decision for you, is narrow
Collision, the money, and fame, the pharaoh
The physic, the chemist, the lame
Collateral for Kendrick whenever exchange
Compatible for riches with more to gain

Dont be scared to put the fears to shame
When you know what you got
Sacrifice aint that hard
Feel like dependin on me
Sometimes we aint meant to be free

Come, come now, last call, who want some?

Two lips to kiss, 22 mother nuns
God blessed my tongue, I need it for life
Awkward like Cartwright, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
Its condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?
I really want it - need it
Break bread - or break fast
Before I blast and break legs, ride past
And they scream out little Johnny is dead! 
You wish me well, I wish you Hell
Eternity, no such thing as time will tell
Infirmary, burn like magnetic combustion
Bad credit with me, and paramedics are hustlin

A life hit a nigga with a lemons limelight
But at night, we still committin crimes, spittin rhymes
Bought a coupe with the spinnin rims, get inside
Bring a friend, bleedin hands from the genocide
Clean me up, beam me up to the other side
Brothers die, cause coons turn to butterflies
They dont wanna see me sittin in the Benz
They dont wanna see me livin on the end
Of the city in a citywide bend
Show no pity in the city full of sin
They dont wanna see me gettin to the check
They just wanna see me swimmin in the debt
Dont drown on ground, wait until you hear
9-1-1, freeze dead
Opps on the radar

Young Millie Jackson back to the shit
Mouthpiece drawn, got a verbal armory
Stack bodies, not figurines
Move beneath the surface, submarine
Im half machine, obscene with a light sword
Look inside the brain, its a riot in the psych ward
What you standing on the side for?
Roar like a lioness, punch like a cyborg
Spit slick, attack is subliminal
Flowers on my mind, but the rhyme style sinister
Stand behind my own bars, like a seasoned criminal
Gotham City Streets, Ill play the bleep
Crushing any system, that belittles us
Antidote to every poison they administer
Switch it like time signatures
Colors in my aura tend to cover the perimeter
Brown bodies that the blues wanna shoot through
Hi-res lasers wanna 
Wool over your eyes
My strength aint nothing like my size
Blades on the top, Kathleen Cleaver
Tangle my cords like a weaver
Opps on the radar

They wonder why I do drugs and hang with thugs
Since I made it, the city hated, wait, where is the love?

Still a youngin at heart, but mentally, bitch Im a hunnid-and-eight
Like Pun in the late 90s, my niggas is juggling weight
Running from state to state, gun in the waist for safety
Im on a paper chase, whatever it takes to make me
A millionaire, silly cause how many really get there?
I mean, how many niggas is Jeezy?
Yall make this shit sound so easy
Breezy, turn on the TV, see these niggas that trap on the CD
Meanwhile, back home, my niggas sell crack at the BP
Hoping one day they can be thee
Niggas is there on the screen
Cause thats the American Dream
Now here go the thing, listen
Hysterical screams, coming from mothers that buried their kings
Or the unbearable pain of watching em walk out with the sheriff in chains
Becoming a number, they no longer care about the name
White folks been getting rich off of cocaine
Through some underhanded methods, I dont got time to explain
Out of fear that I wont reach em and since preaching aint my thing
I just drop a gem or two within a few verses I sing
For all my real niggas trapped inside the game
You know that already
I just want a big ol bag of money when I see my jeweler
Get a hard-on when Im counting up that mula 
Scarface, into living life like a king
Every day eating good with my team, the American Dream

Copped my first pie, yeah, I knew that I could bake it

You niggas comedy, Im laughing at you probably
We are not the same, theres no strand of monotony
Between you and I until we die
Revelations say you either fry or fly
And its hard to find God when you aint never seen him
Its pie in the sky and theres bodies on the cement

I was a black sheep, but now Im just a goat
And Im bout to elope, married to the game joe
This is hip hop at its finest, whered you find this? In a Ziploc
Til the wheels fall off, fuck a pit-stop or what not

Smell the scent of dead bodies ridin down Green Leaf
No peace so dont get caught up with no piece

Real funerals of them lost Juveniles
Trying to be generals, be missing your dinner now, huh
Say its a blessing when you die in ya sleep

Fold a nigga arms, now a casket what he pray in
Compton streets raised me
Cant tell my grandma nothing bout her baby, you crazy
I said she see no evil, she dont hear nothing at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, Ima see you again
And when they ask you questions, you just answer
What happened then? What happened then?
I live this life at a pace that anyone can go
Know your place and dedicate your role, to the faith that youll die alone
Trace your steps when I do step in a fire of broken bones
And I require my hearts desire and when I reap what I sow
I bought my momma a Benz, my boobie a Jag
A car for my dogs, with a roof full of glass
But still I be feeling like none of my light never casts
Out of that black cloud thats been watered down since my first chopper blast
But fuck that, Im not worried, even when its scary
Skrrt off makin them hurt off I should have hurt them in a hurry
Dirt off all under my fingers, dirt all of em gon is gone is burried
Shirt off when precedure, resuscitation came early
I need you to keep quiet as a mouse
Which is ironic cause rats is what Im talking about
Im hearin the sonics of gun fire
The whispers, the silent cries
Even though I know its an eye for an eye
I said she see no evil, she dont hear nothing at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, Imma see you again
And when they ask you questions, you just answer
What happened then? What happened then?
I was born a soldier, ride or die for mine
Tattooed tears and a lawyer, tried to give me life
Heaven can you hear me? Cause I know that hell can
So heaven can you heal me? Im only just a man, oh
You want to go to Compton? Nigga Ill take you there
Hub City bodies get burnt butt-naked here
Respect the code, a niggas calling from the pen
Colombian neck-ties on the outside from within
And then, your momma never see you again
Casket to never wake up plastered in MAC make-up, huh
Niggas can’t hear you talking from the sky
And only five year olds see your ghost when you die, no lie
Karma catches up to all you head honchos
2 dome shots in that head, Griselda Blanco
Shit get real though inside the Foxhills though
Nigga living that fast life and get killed slow
Ask Wack and Draws if a nigga run the streets
My grandmother’s prayers saved you niggas I never wanted peace
Los Angeles, I’m the motherfucking King here
No first 48 cause muhfuckers don’t sing here, huh
I said she see no evil, she dont hear nothing at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, Ima see you again
And when they ask you questions, you just answer
What happened then? What happened then?
Before we walk, we must crawl
We run when temptation calls
Before we walk, we must crawl
We run when temptation calls
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Yeah, often Im caught up in confusion, in need of dissolution
They tell me the solution to see through this illusion Im living
A few friends killed, a few sent to prison
Our mamas tried to warn us, but few tend to listen
See, we running the streets, in search of some trouble, at least
A couple of freaks to sneak home with
Now she ride a nigga dick, just like she owned it
So every time I wanna hit, I bet you she on deck
She got the bad lips, bad hips, damn shawty
Slim waist, Gina face, Pam body
Met her in the club, little liquor led to love
Thats the reason why my niggas cant find me, good golly
Look, shawty, aint no need for games
I know a nigga still young, but I don seen some things
If its cool to talk, let me ease your pain
This is food for thought, let me feed your brain
Your ex-man did you dirty, did he leave a stain?
When them losers talk, tell em please refrain.
I refuse to stop, dont freeze the frame
Cause tonight, I got you calling out Jesus name, hey
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk, we must crawl
But we run when temptation calls
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk, we must crawl
But we run when temptation calls
Often Im caught up in confusion in tryna find solutions
To try and pimp the system thats a form of prostitution, Im ready
The city probably see me as a nuisance, deadly
Singing the Devils song in a repetitive medley, I know
But shorty fire and she admire that Im a pyro
Maniac, I said Where you at, and do you have Geico?
I need insurance that you could sex me the best.
And she started sexting through texts
And sent pictures under her dress
Got them G-Strings, she beasting for the pleasure and pain
I was a weakling, so I cling to her under my name
Gave her the ding-ding, then ding ding, the bell ringing again
It was intriguing that she seen, dont no stand
No flow, keeping it wet, making it rain
Beg your pardon, dont blowjob, she no jobs like Tommy from Martin
The blowjobs, she blow hard like a Nintendo cartridge
That blowjob had genius like Mozart
Got blowjob, then put it in her trunk like Goyard
Im starting off with that Cuevo
Shop on Rodeo, house in the Dagos
We like to fuck and watch the day go by
Hasta luego, drop the potato
Shes hot, what can I say, yo?
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk, we must crawl
But we run when temptation calls
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk we must crawl
But we run when temptation calls
Im losing temptation
Nigga, tell the world

Shit, I’m just tryna get paid and keep them thighs high 
Sometimes, I feel like I could just bury ‘em, bury em
Cause delirium, mass hysteria, no scarier area

So I married that bitch and swung down in that chariot
And you way too fuckin close, beware the barrier

 Recognize what live inside these eyes
Ima ride until the dead has risen
Live in a project building, dodging the module ceilings
I ride, Ima ride in a stolen Jeep
Ride with the eyes of five blind men, my vision 
Mama tried counseling, five plans for Kendrick 
My family ties had sabotaged Rosecrans existence 
My aliens on surveillance, they paid me a visit 
Our stadiums packed, Raiders in black
Curls dripping, silver bullet, palladium in my strap
I lie on the side of a one-way street 
Nowhere to go, death all I can see 
I say Fuck is up? I fuck em up
Your suppers up, and somethings up
I hope he no can walk the tightest rope before the double-dutch
Broke plenty records with this weapon, I protect it under oath
My discretion, fuck your blessing, fuck your life, fuck your hope
Fuck your mama. fuck your daddy, fuck your dead homie
Fucked the world up when we came up, thats Compton, homie!

Leaning off the Actavis, passing blunts round and round
Told me Mary was a go so we passed her round and round
Your bitch texted me, wants it now so I had to knock her down
Hurt her bouncing off my balls, slinging dick up from the mouth
You let it slide, I hit home-runs, clean her dugout till I’m done
I can be her number two and you can be her number one
Her pussy’ crazy, her pussy crazy
You fuck niggas!
Every time I’m in my city, I be feeling like my shit don’t stink

They tryna tell us that we all equal
We get no justice so it aint peaceful, yeah
They can bluff you, they can beat you
Paid attorney, we gon need it
Momma told me there was demons
And she aint never lied on her Jesus
She worked her ass off just to feed us
She went to Ross to cop the new Adidas
She used to tap in with all the teachers
They wasnt teachin nothin, its no secret
Whole lotta crime, lil niggas beefin
We gotta keep it or end up a victim
Trapped in the system, traffickin drugs
Modern-day slavery, African thugs

Just know all of my niggas, we struggled for it
Had to hustle for it, cried puddles for it
My pops watched his sister get locked for it
I done seen my niggas get knocked for it like {gunshot}
Gimme that, I carry Del Amo like a piggyback
I carry my city like guilt that aint got no forgiveness
No way out, shit we locked in the system
Catch a case and they not gon forgive ya
White skin, you be out before Christmas
Shit, auntie missed eight of those days
Tears from me, had to pray those days
Had to slave those days
Shit, we had to hit up a couple hood giveaways those days
Thank God for every inch that he gave us
Thank God for everything cause he made us
Like when that car bent the block, blat blat
Hit the homie but we made it to ER and he saved us
Thinkin that he couldve died, nigga
We was prayin to the sky and his momma cried rivers
Healed up, but tough luck, he tried to get revenge
Had to drop, bullets popped and they killed him
Worst part is that it sound so familiar
I am TChalla, I am Killmonger
One world, one God, one family

I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I aint a drinker, Im a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
To witness the realest shit thats ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I start questioning God, What is my purpose?
He said to live the way he did, thats all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian
And this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I cant help but give in
Im giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed
Felt like Im free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
Then lost my faith again
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
Im just through
Where is your faith?
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed
Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
Thats four innocent bastards cause, papa, they dont know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Cant find no one to watch her kids, so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy aint bout shit, that nigga aint bout shit
Spilt his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night, hoping that hell mature
And maybe one day his kids something that hell live for
Baby wanna go back to school, but she need some help
Because its hard trying to pay the bills when youre by yourself
She thought about credit card scams, til she heard a voice
That said, The Devil is a lie, make a better choice
And so its back to McDonalds and every month dealing
With those crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked Him to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her Section 8
Then lost her faith again
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
Im just through
Where is your faith?
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed
I had dreams of holding a 9 milla to Rays killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
Its jungle when the niggas in zoo
The rats lurking, vultures circling the serpents
Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didnt deserve it
I flirted with the ideal of caressing the steel
To make karma come faster than she normally will
Its ill, to see my faith try and leave me
Its so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
Im tryna reach Cloud 9, thats what my niggas bout
But it never rain in California unless the pistols out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
And if I get no answer, just know I tried
I should have never looked into his sons eyes
Rayshawn Boyce
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
Im just through
Where is your faith?
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed
This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your minds slipping, wondering, Is there really a God?
Knowing you shouldnt think that way and trying to freeze your brain
But whenever theres pain, that feeling forever remains
We cant believe what we cant see and reality seems stronger than prayer
Cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
At the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, thats human nature, you aint in the wrong
Just know when you feeling that way His Spirits in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
And wonder why I aint ever caught that feeling before
Maybe they know Him better, or I dont know no better
But what I do know, is that Hes real and He lives forever
So the next time you feel like your worlds about to end
I hope you studied because Hes testing your faith again
Id rather not live like there isnt a God
Than die and find out there really is
Think about it
The hardest thing for me to do
Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
Thats the hardest thing
Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gunshot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either Crip or Piru
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
With that being said, each one of their rivals
Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
And I dont even push a line, Im just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
My momma said youre judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider, that if it goes down
Theyll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what Im doing
Im tryna duck the influence of my city thats brewing, real talk, and
This is why they fuck with me 
This is why they fuck with me 
Im no gangster, no killer, Im just your average Joe 
But one thing you should consider, Im the realest you know
I was walking from Centennial
When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like hol up
Where you from? I dont bang
Where you stay? Westside, thats a Piru gang to be exact
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasnt wet
Crossed across Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
Chirped the homies on the I-95, they said they already knew
What happened, and meet em outside the garage
Never seen that many guns in my life
I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
Somebody said, fall back, we gon make these niggas suffer
You my brother like a frat, and thats just to remind you
Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but
This is why they fuck with me 
This is why they fuck with me 
Im no gangster, no killer, Im just your average Joe 
But one thing you should consider, Im the realest you know
I dont do black music, I dont do white music
I do everyday life music
Give em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
You say you through, but Ive been through it, now thats cold
And this is for my county building children
In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering
I use perseverance in this mad city
Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
Bernie Mac died, its no joke
Dont ask why if you dont know about these killers and thieves
Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but Im high off life
I could fall out the sky like twice
And land in the land of the AKs
And the minivans where the fan never on
Cause its hotter than a lunatics underarms in a straitjacket
In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, you know?
This is why they fuck with me 
This is why they fuck with me 
Im no gangster, no killer, Im just your average Joe 
But one thing you should consider, Im the realest you know
So there you have it
But Imma leave you with this
An O.G. once told me
A real gangster is either dead or in jail
Or behind the scenes getting real money
Im gone
Have you ever been punched in your motherfuckin face?
What you say? Oh, you havent? Alright, wait, bitch

Just look over your shoulders, honey
Whenever you need me
Just look— Just over your shoulders
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Yeah, you need me 
I wrote my first bars in the car with Stacy
How bizarre, my battle scars at large would lace me
Big marbles, nigga
I lead this new generation, boy, dont argue with us
Marvelous beat selectors, authors, and novel spitters
And its all for the literature
And its all for the hideous, the nastiest flows, the Chlamydia, uh
I aint afraid to say I need you, ah, yeah 
I promise Id never leave you, ah, yeah
My life is like twelve open mics of hopeless notes I write
For sure, my folks unite soon as the flow get nice
The poltergeist that scare emcees, my prototype for every
My share of deeds and R.I.P.s
You know my type of style is like my everything
Apparently, my appetite stay famished
Bite no hand that feed
The culture vulture die and bleed
My focus hold these thoughts and dreams
Control this pen 
Boldest lines of rhymes and things
Devote my time and mind it seems
Im posed to shine, remind Im king
Provoke the blind and bomb the fiends
The pros, the cons, the diamond rings
Im full with time but Ima bring
The soul divine and cross between
Whats yours and mines, the gold, the green
The ropes that show just what it mean
Then grab Shakur right by the wing
And fly before my vocals 
For hip-hop, look at my Ziploc
Bag full of goodies, you Chris Rock
Hit the Pookie and pit stops
Since tube socks, baby, you a hell of a drug
Just look over your shoulders when they fuck you over, its love
I know ya 
Dont you know, baby?
Dont you know, baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Whenever you need me
Just look— Just over your shoulders
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Yeah, yeah, you need me 
Shhh, look over your shoulder, get me?
Cause I done bodied the game to the point niggas scared to rap with me
Kept burnin til they anointed me one of the kings of Black history
And yes, I see the game is a little different, niggas lack simply
Them bars and I spit em like darts til they puncture your kidney
You trash and it dont matter how much you gon try to convince me
And you gon make my gun cock and talk a whole nother way, yo
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh 
I am the Buddha, the Ali Baba, the believer-er maker
So pristine, the dice roll from under my sleeve when I shake em
So rude, Im so ice cold but Im what you need to just wake em
All them crowns and medals on the wall waitin for me to just take em
When I arrive, my theme music got a pound to it
And when I leave, even my shadow got a sound to it
Cause Im the god of the harder, the martyr, the father
I spit a saliva thats leaking a lava
Completin the saga while meetin and greetin
And beating you niggas, completely conquer
Extremely bark on a nigga, you see me
And deeply carve up a nigga, believe me
Graffiti your armor, you heebie, you jeebie
Bikini your broad up 
See me, now give me the startup and treat me
You greet me and meet me with arms up
So sweet when I speak, have a seat, it was deep
I was sleep, now the gods up, hmm
Upholding the fundamentals, while most of you boast a rental
Focus on whats most essential, spit bars to provoke your mental
Do I have your entendimiento?
While I clap these raps like thunders
Look over your shoulder, boy, and wonder 
Dont you know, baby? 
Dont you know, baby? 
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Whenever you need me 
Just look— Just over your shoulders
Whenever you need me 
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Yeah, you need me 
Dont you know, baby?
Dont you know, baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Whenever you need me

Sagging and my ass showing, mami and the cops knowing
All I wanna do is smoke a blunt, let it bump

And that nigga looked back at me and said, boy, you certified
Took my 87 Regal, put it in a chop shop
Stash spot, .45, run up, you gonna die
Looking for a pretty bitch who can twerk it and throw it back
Nigga diss me, no, I aint missing, Im throwing shots back

A challenger is like last year calendars
Yup, youre all outdated
We all amazing, you all can hate it
You can live or die, that’s your ultimatum
Married to the game, at the altar wasted
A pound of white rice on the tribe of Asians
Niggas, theyll ride for me, bitches, they desire me
And whats the one thing they hate the most?
Saying bye to me
They know I put it down, now they wanna say wassup

Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me, rather than societys
Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil bit, love
I want diamonds, too: Ronnie on Players Club
I used to have a nine-to-five; fresh out of school—that was 05
That bitch was racist, got me fired; ever since then, I had no job
Pushing in my momma van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin prolly did
Guilty by association: story of my life, nigga
You gon make me flip and split your shit, judge give me life, nigga
Pain since my grandmas death, Uncle killed at Louies Burgers
Hold my tears, I tried my best; let it go, drench my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist, tryna go beyond the margin— margin
Maintaining my modest— modest as I dream
So while I go through all this— all this bullshit, what you call it
Life itself, I know what helps, let me scroll through my Blackberry
Im going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, thats some great advice
Im going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, thats some great advice
So whatd you rush me over here for?
How was your day?
Are you tipsy?
Mhm!
All I need in this lifetime: Pussy and Patrón
Give me that, once you give me that, once again, its on
Bitch, Im swagged up, hoes bopping when Im off that Screw
Coming down clean, tell your baby momma, What it do?
Where your friends at? I got long dick—what it is?
Gon poke it out, situate your little positives
How I live? Big shot, on my grind, already
Ima lay it down like a carpenter when you let me
Give me that funk
That sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
I cant get enough
If I offend you, blame it on the liquor, babe
Give me that funk
That sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
I cant get enough
If I offend you
Ugh, I wrote this song when Dave drove home
And caught that flat in the mean T-Flats
And it made me think if we could blink
To change locations where we at
We often get lost in the alcohol bottle
In attempt to ignore pain, problem, and sorrow
Just for a minute, then back to the bullshit
Your car note due, and you bout to get evicted
Two drugs, surely, Patrón, pussy, make it feel alright
But once its empty and that bitch leave, then its back to life
You cant run from it, gotta run to it, nigga
The antidote wouldnt last, and you knew it, nigga
But still, you proceed to dive deep, ask whats her Zodiac sign
Im going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, thats some great advice
Im going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, thats some great advice
Okay, welcome to my diary—hmm, where should I begin?
Finna get a Swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step; man, I hate to work for them
One time, I tried to work for me, but that shit didnt work for me
And here I am, stressing, questioning my direction man
What to do? Nothings moving, traffic jam, wiggle through it
Pop the cork and take the fluid, bust that pussy open
Bust that pussy open, bust that pussy open
 Balls deep, you dig?
Retrieve relief, you dig?
Lets kill a bottle of tequila
And lie butt-naked telling the truth, would you?
Whats up?
I had a long day, and I really wanna fuck
Take a double-shot to the face and forget about my whole day
Cause all Ive been thinking the whole day 
Im going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, thats some great advice
Im going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, thats some great advice
All I need in this lifetime: Pussy and Patrón
Give me that, once you give me that, once again, its on
Bitch Im swagged up, hoes bopping when Im off that Screw
Coming down clean, tell your baby momma, What it do?
Where your friends at? I got long dick—what it is?
Gon poke it out, situate your little positives

Playas always trying to pop bottles
Niggas love to pop bottles
Then get you a table my nigga
Get you a table my nigga
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank
No syrup in this cup but this that po up
When you see me po up, turn up til you throw up
Like a bulemic fiending, for hurl over them toilets
If I run out of liquor in your city, yo where the store at?
One bottle, two bottles Im a soldier, never sober
Cup runneth over, dont give a fuck about cirrhosis
One life, thats all we have, Ok lets toast to that
Then dive in a pool full of liquor
Swim laps like Michael Phelps
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
Imma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor Imma dive in it
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank
Used to wake up every morning to a glass of Alize
Hope this dollar shot of E&J will take the pain away
Aim and shoot, shots of Ciroc will make the girls get loose
With it we all trippin off the hen like a female chicken
You with it? 
Spread your wings, you probably wont get far
I honestly wouldnt advise operating a car
Try not to let the peer pressure get the best of ya
And end up giving it up in a restroom like the rest of us
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
Imma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock

Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank
So its that groovy little nigga
Known for popping them bottles
Under my pants be a golden dick
Bitch, everything about me solid
Burberry nigga, them be my draws
Alexander McQueen in closets
Swagged out king, yeah nigga Im Puff, uh
Have that pussy throbbing
Someone tell me where the drugs at, Im into that
Twisting off them molly caps
Ciroc too dont fuck wit Goose
Can I get a shot, swim in your juice
Worth a stack a minute, everyday that shit repeat
I aint tryna sweep you off your feet
Bitch did you see your tab receipt?
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
Imma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

Aw man... where is she taking me...
Where is she taking me...
All I, all I, all I, all I
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then youre like me
Making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle
And the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh?
Dont you feel bad?
I probably sleep, and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust
But just when I thought I had enough
More, more, bless me more
We gon drink this mothafucka down, more
Bottoms up then we pass it round, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
Bless me more
We gon drink this mothafucka down, more
Bottoms up then we pass it round, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
Greeting boys and girls 
My name is Petey P 
Kendricks childhood imaginary friend 
I am your neighbor 
And I’d like to welcome you to good kid, m.A.A.d city 
So grab your cartoons and cereal 
Your pop guns and fireworks 
And sing along 
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
Sing along kids, sing along
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
Kendrick, you remember that one time when we was...
I’ve been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac
Was on Rosecrans in that burger stand at 95
People staring at em in amazement
Reservations at the Days Inn
We was living out a hotel at the time
Breakfast, lunch and dinner, chicken from Kentucky Fried
Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers the move
When nothing else to lose but a burger flipping job
Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine its a mansion
Gold ballroom, AK-47 dancin
Howling at the moon, what’s a pack of hungry babies?
Hope you feed us soon, bite your back, you die of rabies
Everyday we pray to eat at the table at Sizzlers
But never make the visit, if better days was on its way
Then they make the decision, to make the wrong turn
So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn
Oh yeah, I remember that, it- it was the ravioli with the hot sauce in it, right?
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Am I right?
Spend it all in front of the county building
Oh!
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
Dont forget to sing along by the way, sing along
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
And all the ghetto children in the world say, “that’s my car” 
All the ghetto boys say, “that’s my car” 
All the ghetto girls say, “that’s my car” 
When we grow up, when we grow up 
Ghetto children in the world say, “that’s my car” 
All the ghetto boys say, “that’s my car” 
All the ghetto girls say, “that’s my car” 
When we grow up, when we grow up 
Nigga you remember the smoke and the burning buildings and shit?
Couple stolen T.V.s and a seat belt for my safety 
Played the passenger I think it’s five years after eighty 
Seven, do the math, ‘92, don’t you be lazy 
Looking out the window, notice all the essentials
Of a block party that stop for a second, then it rekindle
Like a flame from a trick candle, everybody got dental
Insurance ‘cause we ‘bout to floss, you get that couch I sent you?
I heard that from a block away, probably had credentials
Of a scholar but, shit, not today, them Dayton Spokes was his to take
Refrigerators, barbecue pits, and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
Hello Mi-Mister Miyagi, I want them Kenwood woofers
Say that you got me, if not, I’ll dig in your drawer for it
The swap meet was the bulls eye like Tauruses
Murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is
Papa, you really telling me we can just get some more of it
If we run out? He said, Lil nigga, today the poor is rich
Don’t tell your mom that you seen a Molotov bomb
If she ask just know you have to lie and son don’t forget
Bitches ain’t shit, hoes ain’t neither
Niggas gon snitch, watch the company you keeping
And one day you’ll put money in the ghetto when you got it
Rather than having to hustle off these Rodney King riots
That- that’s right the mothafuckin’ Rodney King...
You was with your daddy on Bullis Road
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Thats crazy
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
Dont forget, still sing along kids, still sing along
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Please sing
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
On and On
On and On
On and On
On and On
Back when Dot was hangin out at Tops in the Benzo
Freestylin to them Chronic instrumentals, no pens and pencils
I was out there Bloodin like a menstrual
With a Backwood clinched between my dentals, way back when
When we was outside with the indo
Hotboxin rentals in front of Centennial, remedial thoughts
Never thought that I would amount to shit
Smoke chronic, fuck bitches, ride around bouncin shit
From Impalas to that Harley truck, to dishraggin bitches
That was hard to fuck, I came up, it was hardly luck
Just left Compton, and I aint have to use my AK
What a day, what a day
Back when my drivers license, was baby faced and triflin
I made my way through crisis, I made my tape
And recorded portraits in front of sirens, I made you hate the vibrant
You cant escape the tyrant, you cant relate where Ive been
In 98 my problem, actin too grown and shit
Cappin at bitches, yeah my religion through songs and shit
On me, thats on me
Raise up, nigga, you are not the homie
Bitch I’m well-connected from my section down to Long Beach
Fumblin with Tetris if your block neglectin your ki
Everyday I wake up with my face up to my father
Makin sure my heart is pure enough to grow my seed and harvest
All my king is stuffin, double up my plantation with dollar
Every dream is such reality, my déjà vu done caught up
Bitch Im brought up with the homies, thats on me
24/7, Kendrick revvin these cold streets
Dont we live by it, die by it, then reincarnate
And if Game told me, Drive by it, I raise AK
Aint no shame on it, cry about it, fuck that, Ill play
Like no name on it, blindsided, aint no one safe
Documentary had identities of where Im from
Therefore my energy had to make sure the better me won
It aint no better one, son, it aint no tellin me nothin
Nigga thats Chuck, Doc Dre and K, the legacys done, BLAOW!
Oh man, you thought these niggas with attitude would show gratitude
Fooled you
From 2015 to infinity its still bomb weed and Hennessy
I can pimp a butterfly for the energy
Game I need acapella
There I go, give me a minute, nigga
Bout to hit a home run, K. Dot, grab the pennant, nigga
Pin it on my Pendleton, trap late night, Jay Leno them
Got my mom a tennis bracelet, Wimbledon of Wilmington
Now can I rap for a minute? Black on the track for a minute
Look in my rhyme book, see murder like when I was a fan of No Limit
Aint no gimmicks round here, this Compton, me, Doc and Kendrick
Chronic, good kid, my first year, 3 documentaries
Now Im blockin sentries, 16 Impalas
They bounce like they Iguodala
Thats on my mama, niggas up and did me a solid
I put that on me, thats on me
You get a bullet fuckin with the lil homie
Thinkin back then like fuck your rules, nigga this is Piru
Slide through with the Erykah Badu
West side Compton, nigga dont mind if I do
From Piru Street to my old street
Nigga this Compton, grew up on a dead end
Got an armful of dead friends
Round here Crips be sweatin us niggas like a headband
Like whats up cuz
No time to stop and think
Pull your strap before they do or you get shot before you blink
Straight outta Compton, 3 times I told you
The third time I said it with TDE mothafucka
Ill make you eat every letter
Spoonfeed you niggas like toddlers, from the city of Impalas
When shot callers take their pitbulls and feed them niggas rottweilers
My clip full, I quick pull, no more slangin 8 balls on the corner
And all them niggas I used to freestyle with, I ate yall on the corner
Call the coroner, niggas dead out here
Hangin onto life by a thread out here
Them niggas wearin all that red out here
P snapbacks on niggas heads out here
So dont you come fuckin with the little homie
So OG they call me Tony
Montana, no French, my red bandana legit
My uncle told me before he died, Just keep your hand on the brick
So I did
Sell every chicken that a nigga had in stock, yes I did
Walked to Compton, hot pocket full of rocks, yes I did
Skipped class, yes I did, whooped niggas ass, yes I did
Fucked a bitch behind the bleachers while on the rag, thats on Bloods
Westside, thats on Bloods, this TEC fly, thats on Bloods
You fuck with Dot, Ill let you choke on your blood
I put that...
On me, thats on me
On me, thats on me
On me, thats on me
Raise up, nigga you are not the homie
On me, thats on me
On me, thats on me
On me, thats on me
Raise up, nigga you are not the homie
Gloomy on sunny days, shadows no house or trees
Prayers not close to me as I bow down and take a knee
Hell goes far as the eye can see, hoodies and weaponry
Naive to being free, locked up, we chasing keys
How your eyes investigate us, while we look up to entertainers
Ball players, pistol bangers, big brothers, uncles, uncles
Betrayed by a lot of homies, all my friendships stay on shuffle
Huddles, steady find a plan, spread evil beyond the land
As I clench down upon this trigger, the burn fucking burn
Every step to getting deeper, survival my main concern
Marinating in Satans sweat, take a sip of this holy water
Hoping God still keep me blessed, with a dark shield for my armor
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Need him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Need him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Promises, man, I promised, none of them goals accomplished
Promises, man, I promised to be loyal and honest
Promises, man, I promised, lied on separate occasions
Promises, man, I promised, my promises is aging
Hennessy what my system like, feeling like Superman
I might crip tonight, I bring loss to life
A gruesome site, look who don got involved
Its no different from wars, its kill or be called upon
Feeling teary eyed, thinking Ive gone too far
Ask God for forgiveness, shit I doubt he heard me at all
They say clean your hands before you eat, rinse your sins with prayer
But Ive done did some things I dont think I could ever wash away
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Need him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Need him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah

Need him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life

Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo, pistachio
Just done mash a show, Dawg is off on sabbatical
Rather watch the Nixon shit than politicians politic
CNN and all this shit, gwaan yo, move with the fuckery
Trump and the SNL hilarity
Troublesome times kid, no times for comedy
Blood clot, you doing, bullshit you spewing
As if this country aint already ruined
In lieu of these mumbling, fumbling
Swearing theyre the greatest
Online they debate us, if we different, then were haters
We ended our hiatus, the dogs looking for food
The nucleus is here now 
Toleration for devastation, got a hunger for sin
Every nation Obama nation, let the coroner in
Crooked faces, red and blue laces for the color of men
Just embrace it and die alone, song of Revelation
Reverends and cattles racing
Devils and demons and Deuteronomy
Fumigate our economy, lluminate broken dreams
And manifest all insanity, look around
Sayonara tomorrow, its just blood on the ground

Nine hundred horse, can you drive that, nigga?
A G5, can you fly that, nigga?
I need tints so I can look at the snakes and posers

I been in my bag, adding weight
Tryna throw a bag in a safe
Giggin, tourin, chorin, raisin babes
Baby Milo wants some Bathing Apes
Niggas crying for less out here
Do what I gotta do bruh, do bruh
Get up in my rear view mirror
Ridin round and round that open strip
I need tints 
I need tints 
I cant be flying down that 110 with a bad bitch in my whip
I need tints 
I need tints 
And its no good for me, its so good for them
I need tints 
I need tints 
I got way too much to lose, so roll your window up real quick
I need tints 
I need tints 
I, I think Im bout to black out

I got the goons up on the payroll
They wont see me coming
They wont see me coming, no, no
I, I think Im bout to black out
Cant see me when I act out tonight
I got some moves I gotta make though
I got the goons up on the payroll
They wont see me coming
They wont see me coming

A lil Compton nigga

One time for my niggas
You know Compton, nigga
Just a lil Compton nigga
Kendrick Lamar
Back with a vengeance
Back with my heart and Im venting
Back with another war pendant, salute me or shoot me
I never wore a kufi, ignore my religion
I believe theres one God, theres one love
And I believe if I fly, we all doves
I make a way for my people to see the light
Brighter than yellow bones
Me and my microphone could be one
Until I see BIG, Pac, see Pun but this aint Eazy
I cant take a Big L, my city needs me, I gotta win
The proof is in the pudding
And I been fucking with Cosby since I was ten, you damn right
Any means necessary, get the campaign right
Very emotional Im a Gemini, I love hard and I fight harder, a born author
A born starter, in the game for real
And the games appeal to the struggling youth with no father
You cant learn if mistakes aint made
You gotta pay your homage in order to get paid
You gotta pay attention in order to pay dues
And you aint gettin it, til you start payin Jews
Lifestyles of the young and the broke
With my hand under oath, I recite these quotes
And if I ever lie then I die where I stand as a pest not a man what I wrote through a rap
In order to see the front, I had to play the back
We played our position, we let yall play yall self, yall made yall decision
We pray while we prey on competition
To flip another page of Corinthians
I see stars when I write these sentences
Words crash cars when I write these sentences
Open jail bars for my niggas life sentences
Free J-Dove, kill all witnesses
Yall better hope 2012 really real, cause the way I feel Ima make yall suffer
And take yall supper
I havent ate in the last 22 summers and Im 22 now its about to go down
So en garde, my God we got these artists in awe
Oh, Im free
Finally I can say Im me
The Kendrick Lamar EP, classic EP
The question concerns
I dropped it and gave the whole world my germs
Hope yall infected
Hope yall aint have no protection
Still Im progressing, room for improvement
Make room for the groom married to his music
I was at the XXL just trying to excel
Networking, meanwhile my stomach turning
Wanted to be a part of it cater it to my audience
J. Cole runnin late
If he dont show up, think I can take his place
Ladies start laughing
No pun intended I aint being sarcastic
Homie popped up with about twenty bags and
Fresh out the plane I couldnt even complain
My nigga was on his hustle I introduced him my name
Said Ill see him on the bubble in the future, my dude I salute ya
Contributing the real shit
Talk about it make the people talk about it
Make the world see, for every MC that I see tryna stay afloat
Tell em build a boat like Noah
And take him to a place that Im sure we all can blow up, boom
I aint a star yet but Im gettin close to em
And if you see a whack artist do more than boo him
Throw him off the banister, shoot him on camera
Then kill his manager
Then hang a banner up, that reads you cant proceed without bein conceived by one album of the 90s
On Rosecrans where youll find me
And all my niggas is grimy
But I remain the good kid
Tryna make a difference where Im from, where you live
Oh no we got to slow the city down
I told the homeboy pump his brakes
He said that he rather put the pump to his face
Sawed off
Torture, turn the saw off, its scorchin
Hot where Im from, the newscasters dont come
Another ratchet got dumped, in the trashcan I aint done
A baby in there with it
She said postpartum did it
Molested at eleven and she always reminiscing
When he was undressing said itll only be a minute
Thats why I always think Im kicking something with feeling
I shouldve been a dentist
I shouldve been a blizzard-cold
Flash, pose, flash, pose, a critic paparazzi got me on my toes
I wanna jump on him like a tad-pole, tad-pole, ass-holes
Tryna kill my dreams
Not elevate
Those are not my dreams, Ill be straight
With a little bit of passion
And a drive like an Aston
Motivation from Nipsey or Glasses, Jay Rock
Mykestro , Bad Lucc, U-N-I
Dom Kennedy, Murs and Fashawn
Lady G, Willy B in time
Ima blow like Im mothafuckin sniffing lines
Go like I never seen a red light shine
Flow to my heart, hit the flo when Im dying
Heart of a lion, tell em get in line
And pass the baton, I wont pass it back I aint good at dimes
If the bitch bad I could pass you a dime
Haters better duck like Im passing a pond
Know Im the king and Im passing you pawns
Pad on the hill thats a passion of mine
Problem is I shine like two mics under heavy strobe lights
Ima need two mics just to get my point across
Ima get my joint across, country yall gon want me
P—
This is a song that makes me spill out all my guts—
Aint no game, Im takin all you have
And youre gonna pay for it
I dont know if I can stop myself
And youre gonna pay for it
Oh, youll never learn
I touch fire, little burn
This aint no game, Im takin all you have
And youre gonna pay for it
Its a heavy load, I stroll on a bumpy road
No jacket when I was cold, becomin one with my soul
Stand toe to toe with my foes, these wolves in sheep clothes
No weapon on me shall prosper, nigga, you better watch it
You playin with fire, burnin you slow, hold up
I hear the whispers wishin, its all cheap voodoo
I keep it cool to keep from goin coo-coo
With a cal, aimin at fake smiles and turn them upside down
Came too far for my feet to fail me
Lord, if Im wrong you can help me now, hold up
Wait a minute, what am I sayin?
The Devil, he busy, tryna get me everyday in every way
I wont let up, I wont shut up
You cant stop me, you wont knock me, ten-four, now copy
Live almighty, my declaration been written
In hieroglyphics on top of the highest mountain, now listen
Aint no game, Im takin all you have
And youre gonna pay for it
I dont know if I can stop myself
And youre gonna pay for it
I tell em all to hail King Kendrick, resurrectin my vengeance
Been dissectin your motormouth, til I break down the engine
This aint no warnin shot, this a relevant henchman
See my opponent, then — cease your existence
Endin our friendship, baby, Id rather die alone
Your diaphragm is dietary, what you eatin on?
Capture your audience with these words, boy
The holy Chapel, the tabernacle, the book of Matthew
And Jesus starin at you, take your turn, boy
See? Its gon take a whole lot of yall to kill me
See? Its gon take a whole tribe of yall to kill me, I never die
My pedigree apparently only to idolize
Ahead of me is only my future and idle time
Longevity, I gotta get used to makin you mine
You tellin me I only get used to livin if fine
You can never live in my shoes, permanently paid from God
When the sun goes down, I scream loud, Ill sleep when I die
But I will never die, my legacy is alive
When the sun goes down, I scream loud, Ill sleep when I die
But I will never die, my legacy is alive
I gotta get it off my chest, push words just like weight
I got to eat til it shows on my face
Tragedy turned to triumph, Im tryin just to relate
Jumpin off of them towers, Im takin that leap of faith
Playin at high stakes
Now when I speak, their pupilsll dilate
Their speakersll vibrate
Know you feelin the vibe, that vine couldnt relate
This next clip is long, a son of a gun, big numbers
Do the math, now cover the sum
I come from the slums, we come for the funds
Like run it, under the sun where niggas livin their life blunted
Countin the ones, but truthfully nothin like hundreds
Keep it one hundred
Roadblock in front of me, Look, Im runnin through it
Stick and move it, sippin that Hennessy
This my gutter fluid, nothin to it
What we lost, we gon make it back
Like it wasnt missin, now listen, you bout to pay for that
Oh, youll never learn
I touch fire, little burn
This aint no game, Im takin all you have
And youre gonna pay for it
Meet the man in the mask
Meet the man in the mask
All those days in, all that stays in
I dont keep it, I wont be here for it
All those days in all that stays in
I dont keep it though, I wont be here for it
Yes Lawd, huh
Hail Marys in the sky 
False prophets get buried alive 
Head on the throne, cause thats where I reside 
Ways of the world, the weak wont survive
Somethins in the water 
Ayy, my nigga, we lawless 
Please move with caution
Who set the fairway? 
Damn right, I need all this 
Yeah, Jack, I need all this, eyy
Hittas acquitted with fingerprints on the Glock
Screamin, We gon make it like two-thirds of The LOX
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Pow pow, becomes, blah blah
Blood on my hands, Ima need hot agua
You gon meet yo maker, I wont say it in Patois
Hope I strike a nerve like a package of matches
You might wanna bypass, this smoke aint gas trick
A prince-turned-pauper tryna to do like kings do
Sweatin in chess games, tryna move like kings move
You should slow your roll before you drown in a moat
He tried to channel balance, but never found the remote
Killers on the prowl still juggin off a lick
Still a— with a double for his bleep
Common politics, everlastin mayhem
Draw to stick you for your figures, thats how they hang man
So whats your game plan if you got one?
You aimin at passengers with a shotgun? Whoa
The aftermath is you in the scope
Its warfare, is war fair? No
You understand? Its probably better you dont
Just keep a dock on standby, charter a boat
Ships set sail and planes depart
The big pictures in motion, are you playin your part?
Before the lights get dark and the curtains get closed
Are you playin your role?
As told by an organized criminal
In general, get off my genitals, I got your general
Hail Marys in the sky 
False prophets get buried alive 
Head on the throne, cause thats where I reside 
Ways of the world, the weak wont survive
Somethins in the water 
Ayy, my nigga, we lawless 
Please move with caution
Who set the fairway? 
Damn right, I need all this 
Yeah, Jack, I need all this, eyy
I had to be about nine when I first had seen it
Low-lows pulled up outside of the Ralphs
After a car show at Dominguez
They had a disagreement, they had to air out 
Just another day in Del Amo
Fo sho, man down, mando
 thank God I never had to knock your partner off
Or be another casualty of war, amen
Theres four footprints in the sand where I walk
I never claimed to be a saint at all
Four Russians trippin with hollow tips
And a Kalashnikov, aimed at yall 
No, Soulo, ho, kept it clean
Ridin dirty, jury would have gave me thirty
Herbie love buggin out, hit the target blindfolded
Electorial college devoted
To hit the score, to write the score thats not a metaphor
Ragin against the machinery, tapin up the scenery
You gotta keep the piece to keep the peace
Got dough, squad up and mopped the block up for a cleanin fee
I dont need you to change
I dont need you to change
Yourself 
But Ive got to get away 
Ive got to get away 
For my health 
Be as free as you can 
Be as free as you can 
Away from me 
I tried to be a saint like everybody else
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn’t wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mines
Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man, maybe I’m just another nigga
Vete al carajo y mámame la tota
Two wrongs dont make us right away
Tell me somethings wrong
Party all of our lives away
To take you on
Aw baby, I want you 
Baby, I need you, I wanna see you

YOLO, you only live once
The battle cry of a generation
This life is a precious gift
So dont get too crazy
Its not worth the risk
Yeah
You know that we are still young
So dont be dumb
Dont trust anyone
Cause you only live once
Uh, you only live once, thats the motto
So take a chill pill, ease off the throttle
Never go to loud clubs cause its bad for your ears
Your friends will all be sorry when they cant hear
And stay the hell away from drugs cause they not legal
Then bury all your money in the backyard like a beagle
Cause you should never trust a bank, theyve been known to fail
And never travel by car or bus, boat or by rail
And dont travel by plane, and dont travel at all
Build a bomb shelter basement with titanium walls
And wear titanium suits in case pianos fall on you
And never go to saunas cause theyre crawlin with piranhas
And never take the stairs cause theyre often unsafe
You only live once, dont let it go to waste
You know that we are still young
So hold off on the fun
Cook your meat till its done
Cause you only live once
Yeah, and heres another piece of advice
Stay away from kids, cause their hair is filled with mad lice
Theres no such thing as too much Purell
This a cautionary tale, word to George Orwell
So dont 1980-force any plugs into sockets
Always wear a chastity belt and triple lock it
Then hire a taster, make him check your food for poison
And if you think your mailman is a spy, then destroy him
No blankets or pajamas, they can choke you in your sleep
Two words about furniture: killing machines
Now, board your windows up the sun is bad for your health
And always wear a straitjacket so youre safe from yourself
Uh huh, take no chances, stop freelancin
Invest in your future, dont dilute your finances
401K, make sure its low risk
Then get some real estate , 4.2%
Thirty year mortgage, thats important, thats a great deal
And if you cant afford it, dont forge it on your last bill
Renting is for suckers right now
A dependable savings
And youll retire with money in your account
Beast!
YOLO, say no-no
Isolate yourself and just roll solo, be careful-o
You Oughta Look Out also stands for YOLO
You know that we are still young
Burn the prints off your thumbs
Then pull out all your teeth
So you cant bite your tongue
Only on this earth for a short time, time
So dont go outside, cause you dont want to die, die
Just take our advice and hide
And scream YOLO to the sky
You oughta look out
One time, reporting live, Compton, California
She go to work, she go to school, her body smooth, no tattoos
Type of girl that’ll make your mother feel comfortable
My pops love her too, she’s compatible, she’s independent
She handle her business, she believe in God and no other religions
Shes never in competition, when it comes to her friends, shes dependable
She set her own trends, a confidant, a mediator, so sweet, every flavor
Just a conversation with her doing you a favor, look at her hips, I want to be her pager
Conservative, affirmative, actually she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins
The beauty of her, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
The beauty of her, swear to God, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me
That girl is smoking, and can you believe that Im her focus?
It ain’t hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on
Five years later, an accounting major, work at a firm
Abundance of paper, she got a career, she look in the rear
View mirror of a Mercedes that she can steer
Call her boss, executive meetings, consecutive trips, vacational weekends
Dior reeking through her Prada dress, probably the only product of her pure success
Got a promotion, now she own the building
Headed to the top like she on the building, real estate, property
She order tender steak, only one mouth to feed, funded a youth center
Invested in some stock, doubled what she put in, then bought a restaurant
Oh what a girl, how great life can be, even though she got the world, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
Oh what a girl, wonder how her life can be, and though she got the world, she needs me
That girl is smoking, and can you believe that Im her focus?
It ain’t hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on
We lose touch, separated, years pass, I’m outdated
She’s dating one of Hollywood’s famous entertainers, Denzel good
Paparazzi spot ‘em out shopping, Tuesday morning brunch, Benihanas
Tabloids paint a picture of a perfect couple
Headline reads when a famous actor loves you, Emmy Awards, Academy too
On the red carpet, dress matching his suit, she holding his arm
She waves at her moms and wave at the world, got the world in her palms
Head in the clouds, star gazing, caught her on the stage, a proposal was waiting
He bent down, got on one knee, she looked him in the eye and said she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
Even if we seem to separate, eventually it’ll come to pass, and she’ll need me
I need her, we need we
That girl is smoking, and can you believe that Im her focus?
It ain’t hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on
DJ Khaled

I only desire to blow, she only desire to blow
And I hope that my dick is a whistling flute, and thats not the instrumental
Now pick up my coat
You let that motherfucker drag like RuPaul, Ill drag your ass to the floor
Bitch, I can admit, Im a recovered addict, paraphernalia that is
Telling the doctor Im sick, head doctor, Im needing your lips, yeah
Proper analogy for it, if I can afford it, then I wont ignore it, clear
Cop me a palace and Porsche and right, when I floor it, thats when I switch gears
Living my life on Uranus, ugh, keeping one foot in your anus, ugh
The other foot all on your neck, repeatedly stomp til I break it, ugh
Bitch Im demanding respect, these bitches is telling me, Take it
DJ Khaled, even if I had callus, holding the torch aint no challenge, aint it? Ooh, huhuhu

Im feeling dangerous, Im feeling nauseous
Road left me crazy, soaring, I wanna
Smoking and faded, I got enormous
Drinkin and swangin, Im feelin dangerous
Greet me by my hand til you teach me to float
Head is in the cloud with my stomach below
Somethin bout this feeling, I felt it before
Took this pill and it swallowed me whole
Pinch me on my arm, is it Heaven or fun?
If I dont come back, had a hell of a run
Taste you through my nose, smell the death on the tongue
Cant get high enough to get over the hump, huh
How many friends around me helping me lose?
How many excuses until Im excused?
Shadow my morning, I aint dreaming it right
Aint no way a flower could bloom in the night
Family tried to warn me, couldnt keep me away
Til I figure flying, I better escape
But flying aint flying when youre stuck on your ass
Pleasure took my driver and caused me to crash, uh
Took me forever, we was stuck in the mud
Chicken crossed the road to get out of the hood
Was drawing this darker feeling, feeling my face
Somebody go hand my drug dealer a case 
Bass on the Perc and activating the sub 
Sold my heart and soul, thats a hell of a drug 
Take this here, introduce you to love, uh
Take this here, introduce you to love
Im feeling dangerous , Im feeling nauseous
Road left me crazy , soaring, I wanna
Im feeling dangerous
Drugs and girls
Ugh, show me some love, my love
Last time I checked, you loved my love
Place nothing above my love
If you leave, come back, like above your butt
No ifs, ands, or buts
Youre sufficient, but I still wanna fill you up
When loves runs high 
Just when you thought enough was enough
Im a kid in a museum and I just wanna touch
Every part of your body, tie you up and get naughty
Ho, we up in this party, HiiiPoWeR, money showers
All the ladies wanna kick it with Mr. Miyagi
Pull up, pull up, bring it back, come, rewind 
I wanna touch up and down your spine 
When loves runs high
Hmm, a perfect 10 living on Cloud 9
I like to drink all the time, fuck all the time
Anything that can get me out of my mind
Im a rolling stone that needs another home, especially
When loves runs high
Now, everybody in the place!
Toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke
Do it til you cant feel your face!
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug
Now, everybody in the place!
Toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke
Do it til you cant feel your face!
Chug, chug, chug, chug
Now stop... and just groove!
Ugh, faded off life
See the dopeman, time to get right
Open up a Bud Light
Don Julio, Coronas, comas
Bad bitches, bad bitches
Call up bad bitches, bring your friend to be a witness, ugh!
When loves runs high

Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, la-da-da
As I look up to the sky

Wondering if I could live it all in one life
Cause it could all end in one night, la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
Couple niggas on a hit list and bitches on a different type
Same shit, different nights, til I live a different life
Sean, you lookin tired, damn, homie, thats all?
Ive been stressing so hard Im surprised I aint going bald
Haters praying I fall, move back in with my moms
Take online classes and turn back into yall, hating
I guess they want your lights out when you the plug
Niggas wanna catch you slipping like they pulled the rug
From where they move the drugs, Buddha love
Niggas sleeping with that MAC and I aint talking bout computer love
Owe the wrong people, you a price tag
Now you pray to God, hoping that you got a Christ tag 
Make it where Im from, stay who I become
Time to raise hell, Satan aint my son
Take a elevator straight up out the slums to a penthouse view
And have the fam there, too, ugh
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, la-da-da

You cant catch me dreaming
About all of this motherfucking money
Cocaine rush, Im speeding
Cocaine rush
Yeah, Im just a Detroit nigga, nothing extra about me
I go extra harder the first second you doubt me
I strive for perfection; at the same time, Im acceptin the fact
That therell never be nothing perfect about me
Shit, Im just waiting on a win
Come up with better hooks, the hoesll take it on the chin
We are 6 Mile-bred, thats why you see our sick style, yeah
Crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs
Momma happy at me, daddy happy at me
The baddest chicks, as yall can imagine, is chatty, yapping at me
Five years ago, I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon
Now Im Cali swagging
Huh, my nigga listen, Im over the fame
You number one, Im number 23, my mission is take over the game
You rollin with lames? We aint rolling the same
Im the best out in this motherfucker
If I could get a check out of this motherfucker
Big enough to set my kids up for life
I could check out of this motherfucker with no regrets
If you aint living your life for your kids, I aint giving your ass no respect

I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
I gotta break your fuckin heart
I gotta climb these fuckin charts 
I gotta do something thats innovative, creative
Just to create a legacy before death do us part
I gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with Tia and Tias momma
Breakfast in bed is head with plenty Carne Asada
I gotta, I gotta find me a wife to elope
I got a—I got a fine, cause I aint wanna vote, I promise
I know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive
But those who lied to the minority will make em turn inside they grave
I can easily pretend like yall but thats not me
I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt
The youths need to know every detail about this Earth
The Devil controls it, so before you scrutinize how I feel
Ask God if them polls important, the end is near
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, la-da-da

Sold my soul to my feelings

Too many Ms to make 
Too many rules to break

Nigga gotta hit the golf course to get a peace of mind
Family friends want a piece of mine
I can tell they all piecin up
And I can show em where peace resides
Since eight years old, I knew Id be rich
Cause the college route, it wasnt bout shit
Tried the honest route, but chose house licks
Tried to lock me up, but cant catch this
Now where we touch down is on my X list, Im on a fresh tip
Too much time of livin reckless
Now add that time up on my left wrist
Lil rappers aint impressive 
Your tax bracket aint impressive 
You buy a chain, but wont buy no land

All that bullshit I taught her, huh
Way too blessed to be normal, uh

So, girl, be proud that your skin black
And be happy, girl, that your hair napped
Cause the school system wont teach that
Where your father been, you gon reach that
Too many Ms to make

Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me, rather than societys
Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil bit love
I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Players Club
I used to have a 9 to 5, fresh out of school that was 05
That bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then I had no job
Pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
Guilty by association story of my life, nigga
You gone make me flip then split your shit, judge give me life, nigga
Pain since my grandmas death, uncle killed at Louiss Burgers
Hold my tears I tried my best, let it go drench my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margins margin
Maintaining my modest, modest as I dream
So while I go through all this, all this bullshit what you call it
Life itself I know it helps let me scroll through my Blackberry
Hey, whats up, daddy?
Im going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, thats some great advice
Im going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, thats some great advice
I said keep reading my diary, when my lifes entirely
Surrounded by the irony of living in the city
I said they wouldnt hire me, I said I got my ass beat
And the only thing can help is ass and some titties
So whats up, baby? I said whats up?
I had a long day and I really wanna fuck
See I aint tryna think about no phone bills
Credit card late fees, Capital One popping up on my caller ID
Pawning my chain in the shop, watching for hollow-tip shots
Watching my vehicle break down on another mans block
Man thats my worst fear, aint that your worst fear
You know when your transmission go out and cant switch gears
Or run through a pothole at two in the morning
Scared to hit your emergencies cause then theyll be on it
See I know when the harsh reality take its toll
Open up your contacts then scroll
Hey, whats up daddy
Im going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, thats some great advice
Im going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, thats some great advice
Welcome to my diary, hmm.. where should I begin?
Finna get a Swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step, better yet they work my every nerve
Cutting me this worthless check, the concept is so absurd
Like a church in debt, a turtle in a turtle neck
Convertibles with turbojets, fueled by 7-Up and prometh
I feel like deaths around the corner like the quickest wide receiver
So I took another shot, Tequila hit me like a nina
My skys gray, my bitches brighter
Always saying lights please, J. Coles her ghost writer
And Im the God MC, join my diocese
Free your mind, dont mind society
And finally, everyone got their own problems
Everything is subject to change like broken dollars
Ima drown in my drink and swim in my womans vagina
Like a piranha fin, it gets harder than Rihanna when
Im going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, thats some great advice
Im going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, thats some great advice

Yesterday, my nigga had told me his brother died
A day before that, his homeless uncle was cold outside
A week before, he seen the cancer in his mothers eyes
Two weeks before that, couldnt pay his rent ’cause he lost his job
A month before that, he lost the custody of his daughter
Six months before that, her mother said she wont see her father
And this before he did a year when them charges was brought up
I shook my head, turned around, then found a hundred dollars
I dont know why He keep blessing me
I dont know why He keep blessing me

I dont know why, I dont know why, I dont know why
Yesterday, I invaded privacy of a home
The day before that, my partner had fronted me a zone
A week before, I had loaded bullets inside that chrome
Two weeks before that, I shot them bullets and he was gone
A month before that, I cursed my mother then slammed the door
Six months before that, I hit my woman, she hit the floor
I stormed out, then seen a black Honda Accord
Them hollow tips missed me then hit that little boy
I dont know why He keep blessing me
I dont know why He keep blessing me
I dont know why He keep blessing me

I dont know why He keep blessing me
I dont know why He keep blessing me
I dont know why He keep blessing me
I dont know why, I dont know why, I dont know why
So today I laid in my bed, stared at the ceilin
Closed my eyes, then asked myself how I was feelin
I analyzed on how a saint can play the villain
Is my life coincidental or just God willin?
I came to grips, jumped up, looked out the window
See my nigga had that same little boy that didnt know
Bullets is nameless, I guess this was meant for
Me to give them a hundred dollars then trash my pistol
Now I know why He keep blessing me
Now I know why He keep blessing me
Now I know why He keep blessing me
Now I know why He keep blessing me
Now I know why, now I know why, now I know why

Yeah, you
Lord help me
Cause I need You
I know this weed is burning
And Im on drink number two
But its all to soothe the pain from this
Cold, cold world
Sometimes I think it can help me
But this buzz here is temporary
So Im talking to You
This sick world will drive a sane man crazy
Dead birds dropping out the sky, daughters having their fathers babies
And this the news I hear
When my god kids, nieces, and nephews turn a year
I wonder will it get better
A little cheddar will make it better
But the risk of fast cash
Will make last years Christmas gift be my last
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow, but somehow, but somehow
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me

But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow, but somehow, but somehow
If I just keep the faith
I know Youll be right there
Sometimes it may not seem that You are there
But Youre there
I feel Youre there
Youre everywhere
And I thank You for
Protecting me in these streets
From danger seen and unseen
I never know
What happened the night
I wasnt there
Something told me leave so I left
News the next morning
Three guys shot after the club
Awwhh, listening to that small voice
Oh it saved my life
Straight to the block, to the hood, to a spot
Cocaine to a rock, duece duece in a sock
Every dollar closer to a drop
Every drop is closer to a cop
Every cop is closer to a cell
Hit the cell your ticket right to hell
No job, no bail
No fam, no mail
Institution another nigga, fail
Go from pussy to a prison tale
Fuck that, I quit while Im ahead
Ship my music off with Amistad
Turn it up and hear the ghetto pledge
Live righteous nigga like my brother said
King Tut, Martin Luther, Malcolm X, but Im the shoota
Top ramen, knowledge for the noodle
Finally gettin praised

Doing bad, still love the need
Connect said its something up his sleeve
Said, I rather bust off them keys
Yeah nigga birds and the beez
Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez
Wanna do a song, but its hard to carry on
And my daughter hungry sitting home
And my girl, she said she feeling lone
I can tell its over in her tone
Only time I call is for a loan
She be stressing, so depressing
Always worried every time a lil nigga gone
Stay strong for the future, stick together, yeah suture
Get a couple wipps, yeah Kunta
Schoolboy, but gangsta was his tutors
Say the money be the root of evil, look around and see what it do to people
Veins full of heroin using PCP inject the body with a needle

Man, Beyoncé, Im mad at you
Man...
They say, Hello , Hello 
I can daydream about Beyoncé all day
Thinkin bout the good times fore she met Jay
See ya know
They say, Hello , Hello 
I really thought I had a chance to be your man
Until I seen the video with the ring on your hand
It hurt me so
I remember you were sixteen on the TV screen with Wyclef
Were you my type? Oh God, yes, I was impressed
You was like No, no, no, I was like 12 years old
Hoping that one day I could chaperone while you were on the road
You wore braids with a bangin body
Look like you did pilates, a lot of sit-ups probably
But bump that, I was there from the start
Even when Latoya Luckett and that other doo-doo bucket broke your heart
Hope you didnt cry cause honestly they were just so-so
They couldnt sing anyway, you deserve to go solo
No disrespect to Kelly and Michelle, Im just sayin they cool
But you? You are somethin like Wonder Woman
And I just wanna hold your hand, bring you to Compton
Gonzales Park, we can build castles in the sand
Eatin hot Cheetos with pickle juice in it
Put that napkin down, you know Ill lick your fingers when youre finished
They say, Hello , Hello 
I can daydream about Beyoncé all day
Thinkin bout the good times fore she met Jay
See ya know
They say, Hello , Hello 
I really thought I had a chance to be your man
Until I seen the video with the ring on your hand
It hurt me so
I just bought the Sasha Fierce CD
Gazed at the cover for a whole 5 minutes, til my girlfriend hit me
She jealous of you, cause I dont love her like I love you
I even make her do the uh-oh, uh-oh, just like you do
She tell me Im obsessed, I tell her we connect
Like Ice Cube way before the Mac 10 feud
Shes like, You goddamn fool, that girls rich and youre broke
I said, So? Im only 500 mil away, theres still hope
Anyway, I had feelings even way before you got paid
And I didnt laugh when you bust your ass on the stage
And I salute Kanye for takin up for you
I wouldve stole the award just to prove that I love you
But Jay shouldve did that I thought he had your biz-ack
What happened, Mr. Izzo? Hopico? Fredrico?
He used to be my favorite til he abandoned my diva
Now I tell everybody, Nas had killed him on Ether
They say, Hello , Hello 
I can daydream about Beyoncé all day
Thinkin bout the good times fore she met Jay
See ya know
They say, Hello , Hello 
Hopefully, I still have a chance
Maybe if I sabotage your man
You never know, hm
Ima sneak backstage at a Mary J Blige concert
With an I love Mary shirt, then find Jay-Z
And push him into a dancer, hopefully, they lock lips
Thats when I yell out, Sounwave, hurry up take the pic!
Put it on Bossip the same night, yeah, that sound quite right
Publicity like that? Yep, theyd be sure to fight
Better yet, Ima steal her cell, then call up Affion
He impersonates Jay well, get Beyoncé on the line
Then make up some bogus shit, like, You dont rub the back of my knees right
So this marriage is over with
And the ring thats on my finger? Guess what? Im throwin it!
Cling, you heard the sound, so you know I did
Haha that should get em
That should break em up like a Kit Kat when I do that, yeah, true that
Ima put the plan in motion, thats for sure
But if I end up with Macy Gray, this plan never work
Yee, man, I hope Jay don’t be mad at me bout this song
Start-ay, Wizzle start me back from like the first verse
Like right before I come in
Haha, what you say? Nah, you think it’ll be hot, for real though?
Nigga, you stupid, they probably laughin as hard as you
Nigga got the best wife in the world and shit

Got into it with my bitch last night
She was right, but I had to get at her
Two popped bands and they dance on my waist
Hit the face, that’s the editor
I dont take pics on a jet, lil nigga
This shit regular, G5s all in my backyard
Sit you roody-poos in the nosebleed

Its been a week already, feeling weak already
Got me at peak, possibility of what could be
Situation is heavy, Ive got to prove
On February 26th I lost my life too
Its like Im here in a dark dream
Nightmare, hear screams recorded
Say that it sounds distorted but they know who it was
That was me yelling for help when he drowned in his blood
Why didnt he defend himself? Why couldnt he throw a punch?
And for our community do you know what this does?
Add to a trail of hatred
2012 was taped for the world to see
Set us back another 400 years
This is modern day slavery
The reason why Im by your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
Every piece of your brain
Til your son jumped in your arm
Cut off the engine then sped off in the rain
Im on the dash with my bible in the trunk
Had the vodka on the top
How come I can long time
How come I could make it popular?
Puff on what I want
How come I could make it popular?
Puff on what I want
See Im living with anxiety
Giving up sobriety
Cussing with his sister
And playing with society
Justice aint free
Therefore justice aint me
Try and justify staying, obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time, I go to church and talk to God
Now Im thinking to myself
Hollow tips is all I got
Now Im drinking by myself
At the end of Section Park
Caught you when you walk besides your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
Every piece of your brain
Til your spine drip to your arm
Cut off the engine then sped off in a wraith
I said Hiiipower, one time you see it
Hiiipower, two times, you see it
Hiiipower, two times you see it
Conversation for the entire nation this is bigger than us
September 22nd, 2009
Kendrick Lamar
To... to...
Let me start off this letter saying I dont like you
Scared of you but I will fight you
I stare at the ceiling and think about you
Curiosity killing me, thinking of when Ima meet you
You introduced yourself to so many others, mothers, sisters and brothers, children and babies drive me crazy I wonder
Why you love people that love people that do right?
Is it rocket science to you or is it just your type?
One of my biggest fears, is waking up 4 in the morning and gotta hear you met one of my peers
Or maybe a family member that you thought was cool
Or maybe a person that Ill never meet cause of you
You, son of a bitch and I wish you never existed
And I swear Id blow your brains out if you pay me a visit
But thats not realistic, cause youll never rot
But Ima still send this letter off
P.O. Box, and when you get it....
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because its personal
Let me continue this letter saying I dont like you
Scared of you but I will fight you
Should be ashamed of the moves you make
The pain you bring, the sorrow and the hearts you break
Everyday you remind me that youre always there
Cause every time I come around someones getting shot down
And all I say is a prayer, so help me, Lord!
Then the Lord talk back, I cant help you, boy!
Thats fucked up, my lifes fucked, was cursed before birth
And whats fucked up, I gotta live my life with the hurt
Of knowing that youre everlasting
Dwelling upon the masses
Of the Earth fatal assassins
Snatchin bodies
Probably, on my notepad as I write
Why the fuck you wanna take my life?
Sooner or later, Im tired and weary and my gray hairs are not in my favor
So when I write on this paper
Its real talk
So...
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because its personal
Let me start off this letter saying I dont like you too
And the reason we havent met because Ive been busy doing whatever since grade school
Ive watched your every move
You slipped up a few times, I gave you a pass
So dont say I aint sympathetic
But you can barely get curiosity, Ima dead it
Everybody wanna know why I act this way
Lets just say... I had a bad day
Matter fact, everyday
But I take it out on somebody and you could probably find me wherever the wolves parade
I was born to be a killjoy, Im an old brat
Conceived by Adam and Eve, so who you mad at?
Not me, see me? Im just doing my job
And you ducking me? Is mos def an odd
So why send this letter as if I never knew you?
I rather knock on your door and just hand it to you
Its everywhere
The streets, the corners, the coroners, the morgues, the cemeteries, hospitals
Heard about it when I was little
Tomorrows not promised, cause any day can be knocking at your front door
War, genocide, homicide, suicide all coincide
Signed and sealed by the living
Make it, dont take it
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because its personal
When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now, thats the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me ya love me
Cause Ive been drinking too much, thinking too much
We aint been keeping in touch
Fell into lust, where is the love?
My independency got tendencies of lack of trust
I look at the street corners as my new woman
Seductive as she want to be, hands all on my garments
And luckily, being in denial aint the case
Cause I know shes unfaithful
Instead Im grabbing her waist
And every part of her is tasteful
I know youre feelings hating
In fact, you think Im ungrateful.. I know
Selfish as I wanna be and every time you under me
I get the vibe you might need some time to grow
When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now, thats the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me ya love me
Cause I been drinking too much, thinking too much
We aint been keeping in touch
And every time that I think of your touch
Adrenaline pump, give me that rush
Im going like a thief inside the wind
Lord forgive me for my sins
I know she want me more, but I fiend for benjamins
She said I found the root of all evil
And lost a friend
Lost in the world of a young boy from Compton
That never knew love because love was never promised
I know.. selfish as I wanna be
And every time Im under you, me too
Need time to grow..
When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now, thats the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me ya love me
It makes no difference in this life
Up and ups just fine
Gonna up and up this life
Til were down on our luck
It makes no difference in this life
Up and ups just fine
Gonna up and up this life
Til the lift gets stuck
Lifting up, lifting up
Lifting up
Coming down, coming down
Coming down
Wake them up, wake them up
To the sound
They tell you pull over, tell you get out the car
Dont do it, dont dont do it
Dont do it, dont dont do it
Dont do it, dont dont do it
They wanna see your hands, tell you hold up your arms 
Dont do it, dont dont do it
Dont do it, dont dont do it
Dont do it, dont dont do it
We were going home
Waiting for the kids
School bus to arrive
Oh, but you know, theyre gonna do it anyway
Reaching for your keys
Wait, is that your phone?
Got a TBI
Wait, is that police?
Get out for what?
Im not your guy
Wife behind the trees
Tryna to tell you dont
Theyre about to fire
Theyre gonna do it anyway
Theyre gonna do it anyway
Theyre gonna do it anyway
Theyre gonna do it anyway
They tell you pull over, tell you get out the car
Dont do it, dont dont do it
Dont do it, dont dont do it
Dont do it, dont dont do it
They wanna see your hands, tell you hold up you arms
Dont do it, dont dont do it
Dont do it, dont dont do it
Dont do it, dont dont do it
Whoa Ferguson, oh Baltimore
Raleigh, North Carolina
But you know, theyre gonna do it anyway
Wisconsin, Tulsa, Oklahoma
Cleveland, Ohio
Montgomery, Baton Rouge, Cincinnati car
Dayton, Ohio
But you know, theyre gonna do it anyway
New York, New Jersey, Phoenix, Minnesota
South Carolina
They gonna do it anyway
They are gonna do it anyway
They are gonna do it anyway
They are gonna do it anyway
They are gonna do it anyway
You better duck, run fast from the mania
Dont stare, dont laugh at the media
Brake free, press gas when it enter ya
Dont let it go bad when he ante up
Highway, get out the way
Black man do your great escape
Pac-man wanna prosecute you
Raise your hand up, and theyll shoot ya
Face off, face off Adolf Hitler
Grandkids slayed off
Niggas, same rules, same chalk
Different decade, same law
Keep focus, you wanna get caught with your eyes open
You wanna stay clear of the prognosis
Pride provoked him, watch demotion
Watch em close enough
Dont let the holster break or roast ya
Rollercoaster ride that bitch
Soon or later sides gon switch
You know Johnny got that itch
How many more of us gotta see the coroner?
Slain by the same badge, stop, wait, brake, fast!
Dont do it, dont dont do it
Dont do it, dont dont do it
Dont do it, dont dont do it
Dont do it, dont dont do it
This shit is fresh out the oven
Fresh out the oven
Im back in this bitch, nigga you know whats up
Stackin my dividends
Straight out that gutta so you know just what you dealin with
Highly belligerent
But thats way before the liquor hits
Roll that kushy kushy, rub on her goodie goodies
Crush her so good, she all on my timeline now
Lookin, lookin, she tryna sabatoge my thing
Never go brazy when youre deep inside the pink
Im lowkey like a drug dealer
So dont snitch, my nigga, get your chips, my nigga
Mind your business, I minds mine, lets get rich, my nigga
Take our family on trips, my nigga
But if you try me then your wig Ima split, my nigga
And I aint tryna kill my own kind
But we always losin to the wrong place at the wrong time, no lie
And they wonder why us niggas always get high
Spend a thou-wow on it just to get fly
Another thou-wow on it just to get by
Fuck it, only got one life to live
Gotta push it to the limit, do it big like
What? This shit is fresh out the oven
Whip game cold, man this shit bout to bubble
Big bank rolls, either hate it or love it
Its anything goes, just as long as you thuggin
Just as long as you thuggin, yeah its fresh out the oven
Whip game cold, man this shit bout to bubble
Big bank rolls, either hate it or love it

Big bank rolls, just as long as you thuggin
Whip game cold, just as long as you thuggin
I pull up and park, hop out and swag
Grab the Glock out the trunk, other Glock in the stash
Just a regular nigga, with no chains or nothin
If I do get some shines, you try to snatch
Theres repercussions, and concussions
You know whats after that, end of discussions
I came a long way from eatin free lunches
From Mary County checks to makin these numbers
Oh Lord, Im just reminiscin
Could it be some intervention on some inner vision?
I dont know, cause Im just goin with the flow
Whatevers required, I got it goin for the low
Ah, I parted ways with my old self, Im a new man
New face with a new stone and the blue van
Blew weight on a bad day with my loosie
Suitcase full of merchandise, thats my new plan
This my new wave, this my new tan
This my summer days in the tropics by the cool sand
This my shakin down you niggas pockets, I dont do friends
And I dont do trends
Fuck it though Ill ride with you then!
Bring the troops in

And show you why they hate more niggas than Uncle Ruckus

Hop out a black Rolls on your b-day
Make everybody fall for you, jealous
Bat wing on the ground to the PJ

Got you on, whatever you want, gotta have it
Fuck so good, thats talent
I pray for you, now thats balance

I miss you 
Where you been? 
Its been months and I havent heard from you, I need you
Its been months and I havent heard from you, come back to me
Come back, I need you in my life 
I miss you, I miss you, come back to me, I miss you
Whats up baby? 
Its been a while 
You been good? 
Ive been around 
Different girls 
Different towns 
To keep it real 
You missing out 
I’m on board, next city 
Random call, text with me 
Like, I missed you so much, have sex with me
Not right now, look you know I got the ex with me
She like fuck that 
I dont care Dom 
So selfish and that really isnt fair Dom 
Meet me here, where Dom? 
Get undressed, yeah, Dom 
Yeah, Dom, what you need?
Some bomb head? A bag of weed? 
Good food? Japanese? 
Thats me on page forty in that magazine
Dom Kennedy, you need that
She said nobody come close, I agreed back 
Im the nigga who used to help her pull that weave back 
And she need me, believe that 
That girl is smoking
And can you believe that Im her focus?
It aint hard to see she got me open
And together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on
Whats up love? 
Its been a while 
You been good? 
Ive been around 
Remember dinner dates I was late? Mr. Chows 
Truant like a student, you the principal 
Schooled me on timing, we was both shining 
Like the sun bouncing off the brightest blood diamond 
I was Your Highness, you was my queen 
You got over him when I got in between
Watching Martin on TBS as it was tedious
For us to eat TV dinners every time we was famished
But it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together
Every time I put the head in you would panic
And come right down like an avalanche
Make your legs slant, whisper till you juicing up your pants
Baby how that sound? Kosher, no sir
Wake it back up, Folgers holsters
By my waistline, shot for your heart
And you called it a hate crime, say you want me back
And your girl wanna date Dom, thats high school shit
401K, we could be friends with benefits, you dig that?
That girl is smoking
And can you believe that Im her focus?
It aint hard to see she got me open
And together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on
I upped and walked out, now she crying cause
She need me, I got that Jon Brion love
Had to find love, we called it punch-drunk
We was a two-piece, she was a one-punch
You know, a knock-out, and if she was to walk out
My heart would go black, shrivel up and drop out
There we go again, what the fuck you talking bout?
We used to fuck all the time back at my mommas house
Smoking beedies, laying on the futon
Memories I got saved up like a coupon
And wed be too gone off a sack of stress weed
I was broke then, couldnt cop the best weed
Then she would just leave in a black hatchback
Homies from the hood used to ask me if Id tapped that
I would say, Yep, smiling so freely
That was back then, but I bet she still need me
She need me, she need me
She need me, she need me
I would say Yes, smiling so freely
That was back then, I bet she still need me
That girl is smoking
And can you believe that Im her focus?
It aint hard to see she got me open
And together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on
Said Im a fuckin monster, a massive attack, I haunt ya
I mastered the rap, then fucked up the monitors, mastered that
After that, I went for thermometers, popped em all, then popped in the
Jaw of Tracy Veronica, holla back, they promised us
No pajamas, insomnia, will attack, I attack like piranha does
Hit your block like a comet- blah! And you all know what time it is
2012, mark your calendars, calisthenics and silencers
Exercisin that trigger strap, rock with us, Metallica
Competition no talent, hmm, in the jungle, whats wild enough?
Just might stumble upon a pack of lions
No lyin, my soldiers dyin, this is Iraq, alliances
Lining with stars and bars of a prison rep, my science a-
-pplyin pressure, her stretcher is needed, pay the proceeds
Or you live in debt, yall soft as a giga-pet, you niggas cant see me
Unless you watchin the TV or ultra huggin my silhouette
My flow got the ceiling wet, I spit til I feel my breath
Who sinkin my fuckin chest? She fuckin the fuckin best
Mean my dick is the dick of death, mean Im killin that pussy
Like Spike whenever that Jerry slept
Yeah, Dre
Me and Andre the Giant, 67 and climbin
Whether you storm to your climate, whether youre beat makin or rhyming
Bumpin some Phyllis Hyman, hand full of diamonds like Jay fans
On a island with Ray Bans, hlasses palmin asses
That probably came wit a great tan, hehe
I be the motherfuckin mecca of this hub city spectrum
Where they at? I will dissect them like a fucking frogs rectum
Why you wreckin with irreputable? My worst flow incredible
They probably call the federal after I slaughter several
Etcetera, etcetera, Bentley passin up Celicas
They tellin us about shit, HiiiPoWeR in your mouth, bitch
And Top Dawg can vouch, bitch, nigga, what you bout?
About face with army outfits, the generals here
That mean the hustlers and the criminals here
Penitence reachin pinnacles of life and despair
And me I solemnly swear to handle mine like a Taliban and die for it
Only difference is I aint never askin Allah for it
Only difference is I be spazzin and still a proud poet
Put me in a category, I dont know whats a sadder story
Guts and glory, your pain bore me you aint really lived it
I take you to a block where they crippin
Or Piru that 52 gun bigger than the torso of Pippen
Bitch, I been doin it
Before you niggas ruined it, show me somethin different
You either kissin dick or givin me distance
You live in a district of dimebags and dummies, I know your statistics
Who your boss? He more like my assistant
Get lost, have a egg and a biscuit
Break fast when we aimin them biscuits
Pay cash when your chain come up missin
Q! Q!
Ah!
Double up, shit, what the fuck?
Get me some my promo poppin, setbacks droppin, soon they watchin
I just lock and load explode, target flowed, Im somewhere blowed
Marriotts and Swisher Sweets, L.A. nigga probly east
Cheerin for the ragin beats, X O henny scrape the keif
Bangin C, Im bangin, B, put them niggas next to me
Stop and focus, get the lead, Im here now, let the hardest speak
Ya all them dudes got ovaries, period, run on sentence
Still Im ventin, air conditionin, coolest breezes, ill diseases
Grip my penis, shoot my semen, still Im comin, miles a runnin
I was learnin gettin knowledge, head is throbbin, shes a goblin
We be mobbin over bitches, stick and miss and she the business
Get a witness, pussy frenchin, just a mission
Poppin off like on a mission, proposition, gettin money, drop a nigga
Rush a nigga, stomp a nigga, crush a nigga, dust a nigga
Copperhead gon thrust a nigga, heatin up the winter, nigga
Somethin to remember, nigga, hella sick, I got a spit
Curse with a verse like God told me kill the shit
Load the clip Heckler & Koch, the hoover king
Bada bing by the ding a ling, natural hoover
Fing ring with a vision clearin it with Visine, asian from Beijing
Money make her cum, she cream- feed the weak, thats Wing Stop
At the start with rain drops, autobot
Space shuttle shittin on your car lots- boy, stop!
Could at least got a saturn, huh? HiiiPoWer see our patent, huh?
Workin on tracks like we never been free, 22 squezze niggas shootin off C’s
Please thought a nigga shot 16’s
Rhyme sixteens- bada bing, bing, bing, bing.... bing
If you want to be from HiiiPoWeR
Please come to friend zone
But dont wowwy
You will not suck on my dick tonight
We ball, we drink
Fuck hoes, rock mink
New watch, gold links
She going down, no teeth
LA, thats me, you wanna meet somebody, ask me
You wanna see somebody, ask me
Ay, I tell her lets get in the back seat
Yo crew, last week, my niggas, mad deep
My bitch, bad piece, yo bitch got bad feet
I pray to God, I never flop, I get a loft, a better spot
Another Rollie, a better watch, I get a plane, and then a yacht
And my haters, let em watch, line em up, give em shots
Dont save em, just let em drop
They said Id never make it to the top
But we ball, take shots, I won another, it dont stop
Ya big mouth, a big Glock, I love you all, fuck the cops
We ball, bust a shot
We ball, bust a shot
We ball, bust a shot
We ball, bust a shot
We ball, bust a shot
We ball, bust a shot
We ball, bust a shot
We ball, bust a shot
Okay, Im riding through Leimert, my tires in reverse
Im lost but I know this foreign navigation works
I made a right on King, I seen a couple skirts
I said bitch get in but dust them sandals off first
Okay, Im doing 105 on 105
Witnesses had said they seen a ball of fire
Bitch Im tryna president at Jive while you talking jive
All these presidents, wont be surprised if one came alive
I only fuck with playas and pimps nigga
You a created player like Sims nigga
My cup be filled up to the brim nigga
Yo bitch fixing her make-up in my rims nigga
You just target practice
Everybody say they seen it but nobody know what happened
What happened yesterday baby girl fix your mood
Cause I dont like my head with some attitude
And I dont like your legs less they at the roof
Pedicure toward the ceiling, mollys in the cabinet too
Pop, pop, pop, popping pussy rather casual
Section 80 paid me ho so this is what I had to do
Ball, I ball, iPhone, million dollar missed calls
I hit the bank, withdrawals
I make her plank, with no drawers
Mothafucka, I ball
But the bottom line is
I’m talking right now, and let me tell ya something
If you like talking to me on this show
You’ll let me talk when Im out here
The bottom line for these people right here is
If you’re a man, you don’t cry about it
Ya take life, the ups and downs
If you’re a real man, ya never go down, ya just stay up
That’s why I’m the World Champion
That’s why this sport coat cost Eight hundred dollars
And that cost two hundred
And I dunno what that cost, I’d be ashamed to wear it
That’s why I wear Lizard shoes, and a Rolex watch
And I’ve got a limousine sitting out there, a mile long
With twenty-five women, just dying for me to go
Woo!
Because Im the World Champion, sucker
No mans gonna take this from me unless its done in the ring
And next time you have the opportunity, talk to your accountant
And look who built the building your officed in
One time
Reporting live
Compton, California
Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?
Back down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep
Chasing for the wind but you never win the track meet
Oh, what a cold world for a broke nigga, its bitter
And lifes a bitch, dont hit women, so I bit her
I struck enough pain let her know I wasnt playing
I was so sincere like Nas first name in Belly
They tell me, its very difficult to see 25
And if I survive its probably with a celly
My opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
In the ghetto rather in some heels like Giuseppes
They want me unemployed, until I hit the streets
Fulfilling voids of broke D-Boys selling weed
Fucking up my prestige, til I live with the blues
BB King or the neighbors of Snoop, thats why Im
In the club like fuck it, though
They say its only one life, life, life
And if you say I cant live comfortable
Ima tell you thats a lie, lie, lie
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
Through the barbed wire
We are, we are 
We are, we are 
Through the, through barbed 
We will, will break 
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
Through the barbed wire
Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?
Tryna get away from the worlds stereotype
Barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny, she desperately
In need of some inspiration, see what the people saying
She gon have a baby then flee from her education
At the age of 16, credit card scam schemes
See a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality
Shell never get by, no how, no way
Welfare recipient, property of the state
Housing, Section 8, corner store prostitute
The owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that shes cute
Hoodrat trashy, six baby daddies
And this baby daddy is new to the family
Chilling in pajamis, waiting on the first
Fast forward spilling drinks on her fur, thats why she
In the club like fuck it, though
They say its only one life, life, life
And if you say she cant live comfortable
She gon tell you thats a lie, lie, lie
So while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
Through the barbed wire
We are, we are 
We are, we are 
Through the, through barbed 
We will, will break 
So while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
Through the barbed wire
Have you ever felt like, you finally got life
You finally got right? No longer a black sheep
Living off ya dreams like Christina uh-Milian
In the front seat of a convertible eloping to get married
What a feeling of overcoming the odds
Its like we just hit the lottery, my God
There must be a God, cause golly
You done made it through the fight while squabbling Ali
Now ya lifestyles looking up and you escaped the crooked cuffs
And you aint have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks
And she aint have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar
Making good decisions, got a independent business-mind
And both of y’all are steady grindin, doing it the legal way
Just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
But they wont give you the credit, disses out they mouth
You must have joined the Illuminati just to ball out
In the club like fuck it, though
They say its only one life, life, life
And if you say they cant live comfortable
They gone tell you thats a lie, lie, lie
So even if you overcame doubt and ya living aint bad
Know its a barbed wire thats always in your path
Through the barbed wire 
Then everybody say...
Cause I wont get caught again
And Im here to stop the trends
You can catch me if you try
Disappear into the night
And Im gone
So you made it past all the barbed wires?
Theres one more left Gunshot
One time, I took a swim in the Nile
I swam the whole way, I didnt turn around
Man, I swear
It made me relax when I came down
I felt liberated like free birds, Im stimulated now
Plunging away less my bodys on top
All of these currents might cost me my life right now
When danger finds me, it follows with tides
Many miles ahead of me, still Im in stride
She said
Hey little buddy, where you goin?
Im not sure, but I know Im still in motion
This aint regular, I seen regular
These streams may take me out to the ocean
Told myself if I dive in it without precaution of a lifejacket
Then Ill dive in it til I am exhausted and Im type lacking
Waistline on four deep, senses on four deep
Feel like theres four me
One time, I took a swim in the Nile 
I swam the whole way, I didnt turn around
Man, I swear 
It made me relax when I came down 
I felt liberated like free birds, Im stimulated now 
Plunging away less my bodys on top 
All of these currents might cost me my life right now 
Where danger finds me, it follows with tides 
Many miles ahead of me, still Im in stride
Thats some good
Got the Nile runnin through my body
Look at my natural, Im so exotic
Darker the berry, sweeter the fruit
Deeper the wounded, deeper the roots
Nubian doused in brown, Im lounging in it
Fountain of Youth, I said Im drowning in it
Im in the Nile, deep in denial
Im in the Nile, deep in denial
Thats some good
Lyrics from Snippet 1
Its alive, its moving
Its alive, oh its alive
Its alive, its alive
Its alive in the name of god
Now I know what it feels like to be God
I, K-Dizzle
I rap with a Pyrex in the projects
Im crack in a pot, Im a prospect
Im a pirate on a dock full of dope, uh
I can dissect any rapper
You could vote for the Lochness
You can not test no King in a Tesla
Bitch, I ride like a freight train parked outside
And my young niggas came with the extras, uh
Its Alive ...
Lyrics from Snippet 2
...Im not a newcomer, Im a new wonder elite
Break the handcuffs, choke slam the officer...
Return of the mack, return of the mack
Return of the mack, you know that I’ll be back
Return of the mack, return of the mack
Return of the mack, you know that I’ll be back
Today is the day I get out on my feet
Remove them chains, they shackled on me
Press my luck, stop fucking with them hoes that cluck
Cause the same motherfuckers the ones that got me stuck
Tryna use me up ’til my tank on E
Then leave me stranded, scrambling in these streets
For a dollar a day until my pockets is straight
Soon as you move out the hood them niggas hollering you fake
Make ‘em swallow the bass from the Kicker
I’d rather be a dead man than a nigga
I’d rather roll chrome rims than a swisha
I gotta make moves, I can’t hang with ya
That used to be the fly shit back in ’95
But now I want a crib and a car I can drive
And ain’t nobody out there help me cause I’m grown
Gotta leave them childish games alone
Nigga I’m on
I’m in the hood still praying for a piece of faith
I know he on his way I’m hoping he don’t make it late
I’m up the bat, I just hope I make it to the plate
I’m Babe Truth, you can tell ‘em I’m one of the greats
Used to shoot for the stars now my aim live
I’m the truth nigga something that your name not
A thousand watts aint a thing that I can’t shine
It aint a wrist or a chain that I cant rock
Tell ‘em I’m on something like city lights
I used to be out they sights, tinted like city nights
Now a nigga be city to city on plenty flights
You can tell ‘em I put on for my city in plenty fights
Tell ‘em I aint gon lose they heated like I’mma tan em
I’m bout to throw ‘em in this drop with no ceilings so I can fan ‘em
Pull up on the bike same color the Phantom
And jump out on them haters just to tell ‘em I couldn’t stand ‘em
Yeah, I’m on top of my game yo
The OG Grand daddy kush, cocaine flow
I’m about that cash not that tango
Head shots, dump a whole clip in ya Kangol
Claim to be a real nigga we know you aint though
I be in the hood, all the places you can’t go
Visuals, you can see the pictures I paint yo
Residuals, I just put it all in the bank yo, it’s pitiful
Hoes only after your bankroll
Stay off of the phone, watch out for the plain clothes
Yeah I rep my set, I aint in the gang though
I protect my neck I carry the thing yo
I’m on the same shit that the boss is on
Do it for those in the Feds, up North or gone
I’m on a winning streak, I done got my losses on
It’s ironic cause even when I’m off I’m on
Yeah I’m on, uhh, what?
I’m on
I’m on
I’m on
I’m ’bout to cop the Porsche
Eternally grateful for the support, made the cover of The Source
Flashback to the ports the city of no remorse
Where they shooting back and forth like they playing horse
May the force be with you, bullet hit you
You bleed and I bleed with you
Mama please when you grieve, damn I grieve with you
This a preview, I see you in the summer, my new shit dumber
I’m on
Life at the bottom is devastating
You’re hardly ever debated, the party is obligated
By suckers that wanna be you and never live with the Matrix
And never ever related to struggle and dedication
Your hustle is nominated, anonymous and you faded
The promises that a victory lap is surely awaited
They vomitted everytime that a rapper’s annihilated
Just wish them happy belated, fuck you I made it, I’m on
Tokyo to Amsterdam, Denver to LA
Minutes turn to hours and hours turn to pay
The days turn to nights but the nights never change
It’s funny how time is money used to be a term of phrase
But now it’s company policy, I’m no spokesperson
No tricks, no gimmicks, no coercion
And they say, Bob, man it’s good to have you back
But I say, I have been here, where the fuck have yall been at?
Thinking how Pac lived at 22
Thats ’93, I was four now Im 22 on tour
One, two shots of my life, barely hold on
But I’m drawn to this feeling of adrenaline
With mic’s on, lights on and they gon’ applaud
Young nigga, Versace they never seen before
And they gon watch me, wanna copy shit I got on
I’m too fly, I aint got a flaw
Tell the law we above the law, God bless, amen every lost soul
And the group so good, went solo
Globe trotting, now I’m blowing up like an afro
Nigga thought you knew what I do
Rolling through ya area, double R coupe
Penthouse level now we only party on the roof
Bitch I’m a rebel so I move how I wanna move
Last King, YMCMB
Used to run around the hood picking honies up
Now I’m doing shows around the world picking money up
Used to be slept on like a pillow
Went from trapping in a rental to rapping on instrumentals
Now its money on my mental and women get sentimental, huh
It’s cause the flow is sweet as a pack of skittles, nah
Yellow gold, yellow diamonds in the middle, nah
Stand up nigga, I was never known to sit around
Well as the world spins around and around on its axis
Boys flip from town to town with the package
Stuffing bills and pounds and browns in a mattress
Sending clowns underground for practice
The fact is everybody wanna be the king with the crown
But never in the battle when the drama goes down
Easy to be the boss from behind the wall
But we gon see who really goes down when it’s time to brawl
Cause you gotta be careful about the image you portraying
You gotta show love to where you from all day
And when the going gets rough, dont get to going, get to staying
Put it down for your people and no delaying, know what I’m saying?
I’m on
I’m on
I’m on
In time, youll learn this is about you
In time, youll learn this is about you
In time, youll learn this is about you
Babies from 80s dont know, know no better
Dont nothing go better with ignorance but the belligerent kids that we living with
Some of them masculine, some of them feminine
Member the universe used to be innocent?
Now they just look at us crazy like immigrants
Every day that I wake up, Ima sin again
Im not a citizen, Im just a nigga from Section.80
Show of hands, how many been taking notes?
Good
Leave everything on the table now
Vulnerability
This is your generation
Show, show your pain
I get the top while I skeet off 
Swervin through lanes, I am limitless
For the ones down, I say, Free yall
I start to question what freedom is
My unc put the Chevy on fours
I drip in all black like an emo bitch
But these are not regular clothes
These are the outfits I make a movie in 
Baby Keem count up them Frito Lays
I get the call and I go
Shawty gon fuck all my goons, stop it
I am above the buffoons, stop it
I am above all the rules
Look at my wrist, it say Freeze, freeze
I need to buy a new neck, neck, neck, neck
I stopped wearin VVs
Pleasе get the fuck out the pic 
Hе got to fuck and he got to fuck
So what is the use of my dick?
She wanna put on my jewelry, and play with it
Like shes entitled to it
Im done, bitch, go to your room
I cannot fuck with no corny bitch
I give em ten and be done with it
I learned that shit from the gunners
Mask on, they dont know who it is
Eat the pussy so good
I give her butterflies all in her stomach, shit
Im the youngest nigga runnin it
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Hooligans, they on the way
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Had to influence the wave
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Hop in the ship, go to space
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah
Drive to the crib on the lakes
I need another exit at the show
Cause niggas be lurkin when I hit the road, stupid
Yall gotta deal with the boss
Yall gotta talk to the ones in control, stupid
Even if I take a loss
I stand on the money so tall I see growth, stupid
Turn all you niggas to ghosts, stupid
Take your credit, now youre toast, stupid 
I cannot fuck with no corny bitch
I give em ten and be done with it
I learned that shit from the gunners
Mask on, they dont know who it is
Eat the pussy so good
I give her butterflies all in her stomach, shit
Im the youngest nigga runnin it
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Hooligans, they on the way
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Had to influence the wave
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Hop in the ship, go to space
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah
Drive to the crib on the lakes
They hollering at the K back
M.I crooked slay that, been killing beats since adapt
Yeah me and rhymes go way back, way back
Time machine flow when I was swanging and riding
If you ain’t repping for your people then you’re shucking and jiving
Tap dancing and sliding to beat that you can’t comprehend
How dare you speak on where I’m from if you aint never been
Fried Kool-Aid who made, never ate that in fact
Grandma was chefing for real, made meals off love and scraps
Thank God for my country folk and family
Instead of a metaphor I’d rather take it by James Anderson
Damaging how they televised Basketball Wives
And not tornadoes in the South and how we lost lives
Still rebuilding, pray for the children that have no hero
Only the villains that tell them get money
Sleep when you die, I find it funny
Because when you rest in peace don’t mean fast asleep in slumber
Thank God and stay humble
Real rock, rap and not to Xerox, weird not
Enough to make you fear a lot from here watch
I ran scrimmage and I fought to the damn finish
And I popped eyes open without eating me canned spinach
My fans in it constantly tellin me I can win it
If I stand grimace damagin man every damn minute
I blend then expands quick it slams wicked rhyme
Grand spittage, H.A.M. with it, fam dig its N9ne
Chea, hard to see me like the background
Your rap styles comin softer than a cat’s meow
Red laces big-booted like I’m Iraq bound
That frown will get you ate by my cannibal from Sac Town
So relax pal, pat down, gat down, bat down, blackout
With a fat smile I might react foul, so don’t make this cat growl
I caught everybody when I spazzed, wow—who do I catch now?
Cleveland, what up?
Yeah, Kells, uh, Cobains back
I smell like teen spirit, man, Cobains back
And I got these teens screaming like Cobains back
You try me and I’ll make you a legend like Cobain’s strap—blaat
They say I’m wasting my time
Where the watch at? How he got that?
They say it wasn’t my time
Where the watch at? Now watch that
Speed of my syllables rhymes, better clock that
Stop that, Bad Boy gave me the contract and I dot that
Now who the heck is this, with his pants red as 666
All up in your girlfriend’s TwitPics?
That Eastside boy up out the 216
That’s making these other rappers get Melo like the Knicks, eh
Get you spitters huck-to finished
And when yall win the game and the cypher was a scrimmage
So everybody gossiping tell a friend and a pigeon
How this white boy just bodied Black Entertainment Television
Lace Up!
Pushing a hoopty, bumping the Fugees
My life is a scary movie, your life is a male groupie
Kendrick Lamar broke the handle with 22 Uzis
Stuffed it in my mouth and cack-cack-cack!
Killed the rappers that knew me
Compton’s most wanted, I live my life in a dungeon
Came out a dragon I can probably touch the sun with...
My bare hands, what are your plans? To win a Grammy?
Sweet taste of victory, like Oprah’s punany?
Don’t judge me that’s just some irony, trust me
I like to laugh and get lucky
My sense of humor is rumored to be a Gemini’s company
Come with me, in the planet rock
And I plan to rock in a plantation
Chasing many legends that made it
Face it you will never be Pac-10 even when the planet stop
I’m 2012 on a 12-inch, aiming straight at your pelvis
Elvis would come back as a Black if he was hot
You’re just a mascot on a Kim Kardashian ass-shot
Full-blooded pedigree, prize fighter special breed
My flow slow, they say it got special needs
I’m talking Ritalin, maybe even Adderall
Four bars from me would probably kill your whole catalog
Sixteen would make Deborah Lee cut the channel off
Thirty-two would make Paul Bunyan take the flannel off
Sixty-four would make your mama want sixty more
I eat haters, check the crumbs on my kitchen floor
They say my music’s pop
I call it buyin cribs for my mama, shakin hands with Obama
And if you don’t believe me go online and check the pic
And if you check my flip cam you’ll see your sister in a flick
I’m perfect from the field it’s like I can’t miss
I’m on a rant like Durant no pick no assist
Yall tripping on TIP, get off my man neck
I’m just saying Martha Stewart left prison in a jet
Its just me out here
At least thats what it feels like
They said I wouldnt make it
That this was a City of Broken Dreams
But somehow lost angels broke cages
They seen animals, we made stages
Became famous by freeing the world of their own danger
Prison mentalities, were all hanging from propaganda
Victim-blaming, all divided with remainders of Mikes, Trayvons, and Oscars
Given to common legends, no acting
The new Selma is happening right now
Momma I made it
I killed this freestyle before they killed me
They saw Rodney, you saw a king
Realize how powerful you are and break free
LA, cant believe I fell in love in the city of LA
LA, its the city of angels, it can take you anywhere
LA, LA, LA, we fell in love in LA, LA, LA
We fell in love
In the city of the gangbang
Yeah, we still dying over red and blue stripes
Chuck my set up and it feel good
Cause dont nobody love you more than your neighborhood
We always had bitches, we dont love those
Grew up around the gangsters and the cutthroats
Be careful where you at, you might get bust on
Yeah, all my South Central niggas, Inglewood, twist your fingers up
Compton and Watts, Eastside, always turning up
Bad bitches up at Greystone and Supperclub
Tell em where were from like
LA, cant believe I fell in love in the city of LA
LA, its the city of angels, it can take you anywhere
LA, LA, LA, we fell in love in LA, LA, LA
We fell in love
God, let me right my wrongs, God, let me write this song
God in the middle with a month
Let me hit the pawn shop, momma said we need a loan
God, let me dedicate this to the 80% that aint never coming home
God, let me know you exist
In a city where a hundred hollow-tips get thrown
Im off that Centennial
Fuckin at the party, nigga, at the party, we fade ten or more
My hood came thinkin we yellin, We in this bitch
Then we yellin, We in your bitch
Or you tellin all of us our dwellin inside of 2Pacalypse, thug life
And we off that whoopty-whoopty-whoop
And we in that hoopty with the two choppers
So were guaranteed to shoot
Lock us in the L.A. County zoo
Watch us eat a bear alive and ooh
This feels so good to keep it true
This feels so good, Im keepin you
Hope Im teachin you all the lessons I learned
When I made that turn off the 110
Watch that marijuana just burn
This shit just make you wanna just sin
See that Staples Center high earnin if the Lakers get me a win
Im gon liquor shot in memory of Pac, Makaveli live again
Bitch, Im in L.A. yeah, yeah, motherfucker
LA, cant believe I fell in love in the city of LA
LA, its the city of angels, it can take you anywhere
LA, LA, LA, we fell in love in LA, LA, LA
We fell in love
My nigga so many fell down round here and they wont tell
And I ain’t talking love girl but I know how you feel
And youve been living in fear
Remember Im right here
They got your world on wheels
Girl let’s roll through them hills off the ten
Rolling, with ya cousin & em
Real shit aint nobody fake, they is and they ain’t from here
City of LA, city of LA 
City of LA, South Central, Inglewood
City of LA, Compton, Long Beach, Watts City, LA
LA, cant believe I fell in love in the city of LA
LA, its the city of angels, it can take you anywhere
LA, LA, LA, we fell in love in LA, LA, LA
We fell in love
This is where it started all off nigga
But now, look at where we at now, like what the fuck
I mean you... the first song is L.A.
So then after that, it goes from LA to all over the world
Into my world
Theres this power that pulls us closer
Deeper in love
Theres this power that pulls us like magnets
I feel your energy 
Its coming through 
Took me a century 
To get next to you 
Plus make some enemies 
Invested in you 
So, I feel your energy 
Invested, pursue 
The power of the dussy make a grown man cry
The day I came up out my mama I saw a grown man cry
They say it has magic powers, even Magic ain’t die
Wake you up out ya sleep to take a 3am car ride
He said the booty the only thing between him and God
They love the booty, sacrifice they family and job
Badge make police feel powerful in the hood
Guns make us feel powerful but they don’t do no good
I know my blackness powerful and they dont like that
I know some niggas sold theirs, sit back and watch em tap dance
Bombs over Baghdad to have a flag to brag bout
Dont make you a big boy, cause you got a nice stack
Carolina home boy, you know we keep a Stackhouse
Thats power when you know the game, Im feeling like a Champ now
I went the rap route, homie get out the trap house
I want the power to be able rap bout what I rap bout
Black child
God, love and textiles
Point, blank decimal
Steph Curry projectile
I saw the goal from 8 miles
With every stone you threw I picked it up and built a powerhouse
Caught a case
I got murder in my profile
Niggas still billin’ me
See, thats just the appeal in me
Respek on my name
Why yall niggas so emotional?
Power
I feel your energy 
Its coming through 
Took me a century 
To get next to you 
Plus make some enemies 
Invested in you 
So, I feel your energy 
Invested, pursue 
Power up with the word
I got it from my God
He said a good shepherd don’t trip over what they heard
Let em talk the talk until the night you choose to go and purge
I came up when the rest of you struggled and failed to flourish
Conversations with florist
She said Im good as herbs
Get em high, get em high from the hood to the suburbs
No one can take your power even if a storm occurred
It aint man-made, but whether or not you paid don’t help or hurt
Its a perk
Jamla Squad written on my shirt
I got a lane but all the lines around me dotted, I can merge
I can do what you can but you cant do the same with words
As I, now watch my street cred go multiply
They say the streets respect the real ones
No one as real as I
Its just me and young blood, this where I get all of my power
The night I got a chain from Mr. Flowers
I gave it back when I got done rappin; the same hour
I aint Five Percent, ‘less we talkin the top emcees
And Im in the top of that, the rest beneath me all cowards
When it spits, look around, it’s meteor showers
I watch the stars fall, fall, fall, yeah this what you call power
Into my world
Theres this power that pulls us closer
Deeper in love
Theres this power that pulls us like magnets
Let’s talk about power
Lets talk about yours and ours that paid the allowance
Lets talk about hundred-thousand kids ravin’ and bouncin
Cravin and drownin in words the day I pronounce it
Lets talk about power
Lets talk about doers and donters
The house I built when I was homeless and sleepin in corners
Sharin’ Coronas and Black & Milds
Donuts in El Caminos
Talkin’ loud, scrapin and combin
Residue every mornin
Talk about legacy
Lets talk about the life of celebrity
Verses integrity
Curse the first one that thirst for necessity
Searching for equity
Verses the earth that birthed us indefinitely
Verse the verse I wrote in jeopardy
Surfin the laws of the universe and destiny
Church and a God is all that’s ever been ‘head of me, aw
Lets talk about my power, the golden child was
Granted to be on your cameras and store counters
He’s bananas, competitive, we can dance
See the damage, no more fo’ he peed his pants
My second LP had real niggas on POTUS lawn
My seven trophies is at my Grannys and Heaven arms
Im in Jamaica like “wah gwaan,” my feet is out
My hair is long and patois comin from my mouth
Me, I go outdoors its time to bless up erryuhn
Rude boy, me, I aint worry bout it, fearless
I shot niggas, then shot movies ten years later
Dear God, why you show me so much favor?
Amongst the haters and wickedness 
Deliver this child from evil convictions and frivolous 
Debates about whos the preeminent emcee of the millennium
And its all for the Benjamins
And Im all of yall nemesis
And Im all in all happy none of yall can fathom who Kendrick is
The only One that ever did wrote the Book of Genesis
Motherfucker, thats power
Into my world
Theres this power that pulls us closer
Deeper in love
Theres this power that pulls us like magnets
And may the force that be with us forever
Be right here to guide us
Your sensitivity is very sensitive to mine
Hey, what up, cuz? Man

If it aint a half a million when you race

If you good with good, not great 
Far as Im concerned, it’s in the way 
No remote on the G5 Plane 
Far as Im concerned, its in the way 
You can’t fall back to sleep once you awake 
Far as Im concerned, its in the way 
You aint supposed to worry about it when you pray 
Far as Im concerned, its in the way 
If what you doin dont help you elevate 
Far as Im concerned, its in the way

But they will not get none, nah 
Hes watchin me 
They will not get none, nah 
The stars will keep fallin, like asteroids we ballin
So they will not get none, nah 
Watchin me 
I was down, bad, then my life switched 
What a crisis, my Black Seville with no license 
I was lifeless, I was deadweight, I was triflin 
Then my eye twitched, then my hand shook, and my fist balled
Then my right wrist took a risk for us
Saw lightning that made titans 
With a pitchfork, we ate yo food then got bent more
With excitement, big wars on my neck piece
VVS be fightin, move fast like loose jazz
I gotta race the world and be vibrant
No plates on my scrape, yeah, thats mando
Massaging the handle left hand on the candle 
Im too high profile to drive Lambo, that there is a scandal
That man grab a handful 
Never been loved , bet I pull up 
I got a thing for her, I wanna fuck 
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin it up 
I got a thing for her
I mean I get you niggas out the way right now today, you say so
Take the safe and doctor pay em aimin fore the case closed
Operate, then meet the player move on then for escrow
Hol up wait, since Section 8 thats on my day to day though
Man-Man dont shake hand, he pop shit 
She stargaze out through the cosmic 
Amped up, we blew out the metropolis 
And Ive been too involved, huh 
And I got tens on call, huh 
And you pretend you ball, huh
Ima do this for my dawg, you need a life jacket
Throw you in the deep end, thats now my target practice
Never been love , bet I pull up 
I got a thing for her
They will not get none, nah 
Yeah, all that they talking, that is blessing blocking
So they will not get none, nah 
Hes watchin me 
They will not get none, nah 
That bulletproof aura, knowing God is for you
So they will get nothing off you, yeah 
Watchin me
I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through
Turbo-charged bars
Slot cars on tracks, falling off, game scars in these rap wars
Ain’t nothing band-aids won’t cover
Touring with 7D coverage
Live bands, two buses, my own cash
No budget, no major label fundings, Jets baby
We went from crawling to walking to running
You can’t say nothing, you under gag order
Hopping out of Audi’s hurting y’all with kicks, I’m the Transporter
Think about it, never mind, you ain’t gotta
I’m already on some whole other, word to yo mufuckin self
Nobody else gon’ do it for ya, nobody else
Every now and then someone’ll offer ya help, but they ain’t doing nothing
Til they really see you tryna do something, I ain’t bluffing
Kush puffing on you jive turkeys
Stuffing stockings with these gifts
Audible applaudables homie take a wiff
I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through
When you a man, action is what’s expected, nothing is spoken on
Producer never got time for no excuses, gotta go beyond
My flow is tom-foolery
I smoke these pork rappers so fast they call me charcuterie
I beautifully exude the vibe that’s free of ambiguity
Ya goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me
It’s coonery, it’s lunacy, let’s make it plain
Only way that you hang is attached to a tree
The moon talk to the sea and speak the body language fluently
She makes it rain
When I’m on fire, she always try to douse me
Only reason that you make it rain is ‘cause your diamonds cloudy
I see you from a mile away when it get overcast
Old people feel it in they bones, invade your home like I broke the glass
And let myself in, fighting for freedom like the people in Tunisia
Spread through Sudan and Egypt, this the music for the movement
The score to your achievements, never join ‘em so you gotta beat ‘em
It’s carpe diem hey yeah
I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through
Like kindergarteners
My vision’s bothered by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
The starving’ll speed on ya, stampede on ya
Impede on your pockets then pee on ya
Dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spending, established, with women dining and laughing
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash in–
–to society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
Your seatbelts twice, when I rolled them dice, I crapped
So many times I can build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That’s what my mental say, but my physical’s been detached
I’m on some other shit, like fuck the government
Im higher rankings, where’s the mothership?
I made a covenant that I was changing but my luck has been
Quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?
Left him face down like he was planking
In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensations insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging?
Regardless of who you pick know lifes a bitch when you aint focused nigga
Im focused
I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through
Nah, what you get outta, outta not writing your stuff down on paper, you get the more-you know the...expression, the feeling yourself. You know what you want to say; instead of reading a paper that sounds read, it sounds narrated. Unless you wanna do it narrated...
What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
And real life situations was artificial
They say we only living to die
Imagine if were already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
Trying to cross over to heaven were confusing ourselves
Planet earths like Oceans 11, were plottin for the getaway
When my childhood friends get sent away to prison on their first offense
Its fucked up but listen, we study God but dont know him
Criticize people that work on Sundays, two jobs just to feed their kids
Well, mommas scratching lottery tickets knowing that its just a fairy tale
Cus we aint gonna win
Every time that shes bubblin in, it feels like the devils holding a pen
Dont mind me Im just thinking again
Thinking out loud, thinking the opposite of proud
Cus Im disappointed at my self sometimes
Self-esteem gets lower than night strippers
Hard to motivate the right rhymes, inspired by true crimes
Its not a game, its nothing to play with
Turn it off then come back the next day, its here to stay
Struggle that is
Im so infatuated with knowing something thats waiting after this life
That means what Im thinking is right
Punch, loop the beat for a minute
Moment of silence for J. Dilla, he on his way home
Know he see me spillin my heart, hope for it soon
Wait a minute K. Dot! you said turn it back on, bring it back
If dreams was reality
If it was cool for you to be a casualty
The only way that you can escape poverty
Say that Im weird but obviously you didnt get it when I said it the first time
Youre listening too far if you hear this part
I suggest you go back and press rewind
I fast forward to common thoughts of a human
Deep in my thoughts like Patrick Ewing in the paint
Look what I brought to my state that they cant bring - the industry need a fix
Stick heroin needles inside politics, this is crack music
O-pi-um, inside the veins of them, I dont abuse it
Capture each moment like film, photo-shooting all my enemies moving
Direct them to a casket
Give it to em only if they ask for it, if they want...
If they wanna see reality 
Im losing you again aint I?
Aint I, the perfect candidate to represent the fifty states?
Black President, they dont wanna see that
Its evident...pain is pain
We only love to hate each other thats striving for great-ness
I swear to God that we live in a Matrix
Take that blue pill then we start seeing spaceships
Kanye, west-coast niggas do it the best
Bring each other down, crab in a bucket effect
We learn to live with it I guess
I mean die with it, since were already dead
Trying to cross over to heaven, thats what I said the first time
Get it? Now little boy I gotta sit you down
Teach you about the things that we live around
Materialistic things that we buyin now means nothing later when the dream kick in
Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out...
What if dreams was reality and money was love
What would we do for a buzz to maintain our sanity
Chasing the wind, striving after this vanity
Traveling, no direction, the aimless casualty
American dream or Scarface fantasy
Kilos of coke and the arms of black families
We use to it, our hearts draped in stone
A mothers dreams for her baby boy to come back home
Cus he out pushin that chrome, pursuing that cash
End another niggas dreams when the fo-fifth blast
Now another mother screams picking out his casket
Harsh reality, it seems like its simple mathematics, its not
Its trigonometry divided by some real life
And hell do it again just to get a mill twice
The streets mowed him, cant make past that
Its not a dream its reality, look where its at 
What happened in Manhattan happens all the time
In the hood, conspiracy to cover up crime
No nickel and dime, one shot pettiness
I wrote it in my mind as a letter to the president
World trade happened on the world stage
Same stage look at us as some educated apes
On video stations women gyrating
Parading around, mind-raping the youth
Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out...
What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
And real life situations was artificial
They say we only living to, die
Imagine if were already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
Trying to cross over to heaven were confusing ourselves
Planet earths like Oceans 11, were plottin for the getaway
Im the man up in this piece! Youll never see the light of da..
Who the fuck dya think you fuckin with? Im the police!
I run shit here, you just live here!
I can tell you what it is, I can tell you what it isnt
No more K. Dot, my mother had named me Kendrick
Fuck a stage name, thats the name that I was given
The only thing that I can identify within this business
Im just a good kid from Compton that want to rap
Weighing my options, pick up a Bible or a strap?
I never killed a man, never sold any crack
All I ever did was try to keep my city on the map
But this monkey on my back, yall dont want me to win
Im tryna follow dreams, you want me to follow trends
So just to get a dollar, will I sell my soul?
I look the Devil in the eye and tell him, Hell no
They say anything worth having is worth the wait
Well, I want the world, tell me how long that takes
Theres no time like now, I can cut my patience short
Or give em some more gowns, I dont even want the crown
I just want a peace of mind, and nigga, when I get it
You wont get a piece of mine, wont you mind your own business?
A rich nigga buy anything you sell him
A broke nigga believe anything that you tell him
Well Im a broke nigga, but still I wouldnt listen to you
Even if your hand was on a Bible quote, nigga, pfttuh
See I was brought up different
Whatever that my pops said, for sure Id listen
You said you did dirt, but I cant dig it
It dont concern you if you wasnt born in it
Oh-no-oh-oh
I swear we got to fast-forward, before time flies by
My new saying for 0-10 is, why lie?
And if you aint trying to win, then why try?
Now you can low-ball or give me high five
This is I nigga, look into my eye
Nigga, I am Kendrick... Lamar
Nigga, my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I said my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I changed the name cause I was tired of being like yall
Now finally Im ready to tell the world who I are, pfttuh
And that used to be a hell of a task
Now Im ahead of my class, so go ahead and harass
My character like it dont carry a confidence
That can marry a Halle Berry or Angelina with no cash
Im bout to cash in my thoughts
Give you a compass, then tell you get lost
What Im bout to accomplish is something that you cant fathom
Once the Eves come, they quick to stare at him
Hoping I dont take their bitch, but Im on some other shit
When Im done, Im tryna run the government
These are big dreams, transition from a rapper to a human being
You cant school a dean
I be tutoring artist-es, leave em with no audience
All cause they all a facade, my God
Yall be out partying, I be stealing your audience
All because who I are, Lamar
But my first name, it gotta be Kendrick... Lamar
Nigga, my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I changed the name cause I was tired of being like yall
Now finally Im ready to tell the world who I are, now lets go
But we cant go... backwards
Nothing bout you
Nothing bout you
I wanna tell you
All day, nigga

Ride round listen to Sade, nigga
Ride round something and its all day, nigga
You an actor, you should be on Broadway, nigga
Cause you do shit the broad way, nigga
Your bitch got a ass, but my broad way thicker
...then booked it like the Barclays Center, uh
Nothing bout you
Nothing bout you
I wanna tell you
I took a young sweet breath, and I reached into my Earth
Gave him what I had left
At that moment I dispersed
At that moment I dispersed
I took a young sweet breath, and I reached into my Earth
Gave him what I had left
At that moment I dispersed
At that moment I dispersed
All day hoe, my neck look sweeter than parfait hoe
Rap Derek Jeter in a red two-seater
I can throw this dick from far away hoe 
Ask me how long do it take to be the greatest
Im a bar away hoe 
Damn Kanye never will it be safe
Bitch I already know 
24/7 365 days everybody gettin paid
Nigga lookin at me like Im worth both MJs
Chitown, PJ all of BJ
Chitown, we play for the freebase
These days, dont believe what police say
DJs and the B-boys run shit
Only way I can sum it up, sumbitch
Nothing bout you
Nothing bout you
I wanna tell you
So wont you dance, ayy, ayy ayy ayy
Little darling, let me run 
Until I find myself
In the morning sun
Give me freedom 
Give me space
I want to find myself
In that special place
Whooooa, whooooa
Whooooa, whooooa
Whooooa, whooooa
Whooooa, whooooa
Get out of your own way, hey, hey
Get out of your own way, hey, hey
Love hurts
Now youre the girl whos left with no words
Your hearts a balloon, but then it bursts
It doesnt take a cannon, just a pin
Your skins not covering
And resistance
Love has got to fight for its existence
The enemy has armies of assistance
The amorous, the glamorous, the kiss
A fist, listen to this, oh
Get out of your own way, oh, I
Get out of your own way, oh, I
I could sing it to you all night, all night
If I could, Id make it alright, alright
Nothings stopping you except whats inside
I can help you, but its your fight, your fight
Fight back
Dont take it lyin down, you got to bite back
The face of libertys starting to crack
She had a plan up until she got a smack in the mouth
And it all went south
Like freedom
The slaves are lookin for someone to lead them
The masters lookin for someone to need him
The promised land is there for those who need it most
And Lincolns ghost said...
Get out of your own way, oh, I
Get out of your own way, oh, I
I could sing it to you all night, all night
If I could, Id make it alright, alright
Nothings stopping you except whats inside
I can help you, but its your fight, your fight
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way
Blessed are the arrogant
For there is the kingdom of their own company
Blessed are the superstars
For the magnificence in their light
We understand better our own insignificance
Blessed are the filthy rich
For you can only truly own what you give away
Like your pain
Everybody, just clap your hands if youre real
Middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel
Be yourself, just show me youre real
Middle fingers up
Just let me be me
Thats the only way I know
Just let me be me
Thats the only way I know
Thats the only way I know how to hold it down
Thats, thats the only way I know how to hold it down
I just wanna be me
No disrespect, but motherfuck you
My education stopped at a high school degree
But I can outsmart any high IQ
Draped in some fly shit, call me Jeff Goldblum
Cold, my style making my nose run
Oh, I stare at the mirror then realize, that real lies within me
Some say Im crazy cause I think like I need a shrink
Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit
Rather be in the studio than out buying drinks
So if Im not clubbing, dont think Im on some jerk shit
And California on that jerk shit
But Id just rather 2-step, like my first steps
Jill Scott on my iPod, as my head rests
Yes
Just let me be me
Thats the only way I know
Just let me be me
Thats the only way I know
Thats the only way I know how to hold it down
Thats, thats the only way I know how to hold it down
And yeah I know Im from Compton, Cali
But I dont lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis
And skinny jeans aint quite the lick
I probably would wear em but my dick dont fit
Ha ha ha, I like to joke, got a sense of humor?
Still face, play me short like an oompa loompa
You aint gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
Wont you lighten up like Michael did?
I grew up with killas man, people who killed men
But my character never could be like them, man
And they respect that, say that Im real man
Not a fake person, thats the Sims man
Live my life through some film, man
I aint acting out shit, I be packing out shows
Cause they know that they dont know Kendrick fo sho
And oh
Just let me be me
Thats the only way I know
Just let me be me
Thats the only way I know
Thats the only way I know how to hold it down
Thats, thats the only way I know how to hold it down
Almost lost my life to the industry
Had to look through a photobook to remember me
These label heads aint nothing but bullshit
Have you with professional killas, chasing hits
Lying to yourself, all over an image
Making records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance
My Mama said, Boy, that dont sound like you.
I said, This is the sound, though.
My only excuse
Quite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie
And kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me
The reason why they hate, cause these motherfuckers aint me
And you can underrate me, but I know what Im worth
A diamond in Gods dirt, a diamond in winter
Watch the Simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner
See I give you my life, to mix it up in a blender
To make sure that you feel me
Just let me be me
Thats the only way I know
Just let me be me
Thats the only way I know
Thats the only way I know how to hold it down
Thats, thats the only way I know how to hold it down
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar. what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, is this really you?
Is this who you are? What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, who are you?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
I think that I finally reached the pinnacle
Of finding myself as an individual
The world is so typical
I just wanna be higher than that
I used to want to be the messiah of Rap
Infatuated with becoming a relevant star
Trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars
That I never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad
Vanity, they say that it can damage me
So do I really want it?
If I didnt, I guess Im a cool cocaine connect
That means Ill be frontin
Cooking in a laboratory, hoping I can tell a story
That the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me
Knowing that Im misunderstood
So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would
And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there
Or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair
And Dave said he proud of my newfound honesty
And all I could say is, Will the radio care?
Yeah, or should I say no?
Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach?
You heard my hip-hop when I was 16 years old
Well that was me then, now Im an adult
22, like the smallest of guns that you know
Most determined, but with the smallest of funds to show
But Im not worried
My talent should take me places Ive never been
The world should turn as soon as my records spin
I wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit
The negative you bring, the stress, the violence
The capital punishment, the loud police sirens
Too focused, one word, righteous
And this is Kendrick Lamar, and soon yall know Cloud 9, yall
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focused, one word, righteous
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
This is me thinking at 4:43 AM, June 6th
Sometimes I wanna say fuck rapping, I need money now
Like should I start trapping?
If what I write down dont collect this very moment
Then Im on it, no question
In the streets, my niggas is well connected, lets see
Do I cop a pound of kush, promethazine or push some E?
Oxycontin have me laying on soft cotton when I sleep?
This is deep as the abyss, Im not just rhyming on the beat
I be in spots, chopping the rocks like Flintstone feet
This is me, frustrated, battling my own evils
Finna saddle up that work across Ohio in a Geo
Or should I sell my music .zip to buy your zip
And hope one day it flourish to a kilo
Track record of a hustler
Rather records on the needle, making music
Clocking fast bank like a shot from Patrick Ewing
My nigga, what you doing on these corners whipping?
I thought you had a show? Well, my nigga, I guess I didnt
Im tryna get this dough, and easy money sounds tempting
Especially when your homies pushing V8 engines
Twenty-two on twenty-sixes, Range Rovers rolling up
Three-fifty for an ounce of fire, I hope I got enough
This industry calling my bluff, I need a new solution
Curb-serving, or I might be in your store boosting
Two-elevens with Mac-11s like fuck hip-hop
Dont wanna be Pun, dont wanna be B.I.G., dont wanna be Pac
Just give me your funds, A.K.A. everything that you got
Or everything getting shot, for nothing
Leave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumbling
Watch, the plans of a young man sponsor
Moving grams like relocating your moms momma
Then expand to the Hoover Dam, water, sherm
Contraband, they yearn for the butt-naked
Fuck a verse, verses get let off in thirty minutes, six seconds
I disperse to the world of unruly, where I put the mic down
And pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew me
Youll know I always had a passion for riddling, writing
But lately, Ive been thinking bout taking chances to brighten
My future financially, so please dont be mad at me
I gotta do what I gotta do, no shit
So I tell my nigga, Front me, let me put it on the strip
Then give it back when I think about the consequence
Shit...
There are times, when you need someone
I will be by your side
Oh darling, cause there is a light that shines
Special for you, and me yeah
I-take-I-take-take my chances-chances-chances
Before they pass, they pass, they pass
Pass me by, oh darling
Youve got to look at the other side
R.O.T.C—Right On Time Conscience
Weezy wassup with it bruddah?
Tell Maestro I need to fuck over his beat real quick
Hear me?
Im the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my ride
Ball like 23 and I shot my first .22 when I was 9
Thats no lie, ho
Rappers out they mothafucking minds so I gotta go
Psycho on these niggas, call me Norman Bates with a poker face
Got the banger in my hand and Im out to poke your face
.38 Special, grab it, let him have it, where the safe, we hungry
Housing authority saved my Section 8
My section be on the west side of Compton Cali, champ
Where the killers posted on the corner like a letter stamp
Let a rapper tell me I aint better than whoevers out
Ima knock em out his Force 1s once I air em out
Air jets flying cross the atlas, I made it momma, made a promise
Married to hip hop, and the maid of honor gonna be R&B
Im fucking her too, so please hand me my condoms
Where the honeymoon in the mother fucking booth
Youre fucking right, Im the fucking truth
I put my hand on the bible
Swear to god if I lie, then Ill probably die tomorrow
Tell my momma dont feel sorrow cause her son was a gunner
They found my corpse with a rappers head in my stomach
Im right here, I aint running even if the Iraqis w-was in back of me
Back against the wall Im clapping them rapidly yall
Would never stop what you cant see
Its like a red light when driving with Stevie
Wonder if you can understand or withstand the blast of my wrath
I steer the game with both hands while you crash
Like Earnhardt my heart to the fallen soldiers
You can either ride, or get rolled over
Sleeping on me, I put you in a coma
So please chill out before you meet the coldest
Starving every day, see my face where the bowl is
Bowl on my face, I walk while my mouth hold it
Hold it
Im the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my ride
Ball like 23 and I shot my first .22 when I was 9
21 gun salute
And my soldiers killed 20 of your troops at a time
And I got about nine teens on the corner fucking with marijuana
Jive and heard about 18 rappers say that a bird can go for 17.5
Motherfuck that my sweet 16s be equivalent to about 15 pie
I was 14 when I wrote a rhyme
All I seen was 13 ghosts every time I wrote a crazy line
All these 12 bars in my verses, thats what Notorious and Pac arrived
God dammit I spit just like a Mac 11 every time
I drop jewels, you drop dimes, you pretending to be like mine
I intend to put about 10 of you rappers on channel 9
Straight up, fuck around and get ate up
Cut em up in 7 ways, funeral carried by 6 in 5 days youll know I go for
Money when I sink my teeth in Carter III beats
To you from me, my son the victory is mine, I won
Im the one
The beat was the pussy
And I cum, hard
Sit still, and close your eyes 
Whats behind the other door, oh
No more silence, dont kill this thing we got called love
Just searching for the perfect shot
When love comes calling, dont love back
When love comes calling, dont look away
When love comes calling, dont look back
When love comes calling, dont look away
I used to write rhymes, all day and all night
While you were playing PlayStation, my pencil was erasing lines
My conscious only knew whats half tight
At 3:14, its time to give me a slice, my nigga
This is a dogs fight, my nigga
The soundtrack to life, my nigga
Kendrick Lamar, his momma called him that
He watched House Party, and ate Apple Jacks
Sold Sega games, his cousin sold crack
He pumped Reeboks, his uncles pumped packs
Pump, fake, jumpshot, ball hit the back
Board dreams of being pointguard was off limits jack
Thats because thats these Compton streets was built not to win
You killed the nigga, I stole a bible, is that a sin?
Pardon me though, Im searching for answers
The good kid from the ugly city, thats mad that hes handsome
Where is the love?
When love comes calling, dont love back
When love comes calling, dont look away
When love comes calling , dont look back
When love comes calling, dont look away
Give me rings, give me chains, mane
Give me a blue Benz, red Porsche, red Range
Give me black bitches, white hoes, new clothes
A mansion with marble floors and security codes
Then give me some land, or maybe Ill land a, G5
Clearport, say hello to the man
Give me awards, grammies, and let the crowd applaud
My name til they strain the veins in they vocal cords
Give me fame and fortune, me and Trump on golf courses
With that being said, give me Tiger sports endorsements
Give me billboards, whatever that people will kill for
Manahattan and 40/40, no 40s but rose poured
Give me vanity, give me Kurt Cobain sanity
Give me a city where Channel 7 newscasters cameras be
Give me horror like Amity, no, give me the charts
And if you ever renege, Ill still give you Kendrick Lamar, this is me
And thats love
When love comes calling, dont love back
When love comes calling, dont look away
When love comes calling, dont look back
When love comes calling, dont look away
Now everybody smoke to it, for this is, the celebration
-- TIMELINE -- PART 1: U 
 Transitional Slide - U
Scene 1: Screams
With the opening screams the audience can also sense that something is eerie; these sounds are in the original track combined creating a dangerous visual. Then beginning to see Kendrick pouring his heart out in to his liquor in a schizophrenic manner.
Scene 2: The Hotel Room
Hearing the chorus Loving you is complicated - the image starts to depict that there is an internal struggle going on with him loving himself. The scene is immensely minimalistic and filled with dark lighting, this accompanied by his throne like chair creates for a deep setting for imagery to take a place in the film.
Scene 3: Mirror
The mirror representative of an internal reflection; as the struggle of how he views himself as the words utter I  tell you, you  failure—you aint no leader!, the negatively intrinsic views we beginnings to see why he hates himself for the mistakes he has made.
Scene 4: Tipsy
Stumbling all over the place into his throne - blurred visions of the camera shaking around giving us P.O.V. of what it is like to be overly intoxicated.
Scene 5: Room Service
The skit from u begins to play before we hear the drunk Lamar entering in the next scene.DialogueEffect on the Audience
 Transitional Slide - 8
Scene 6 Part 1: Spinning Bottle
A very unique and a extremely interesting shot with a spinning bottle in the back ground seemingly to play spin the bottle by himself.
Notice this high angle shot focusing down on Lamar with a demonic reflection in the background of the mirror choosing to do its own thing every now and then.
Scene 6 Part 2: Smashed Mirror
An easily missed technique of a reflection of himself breaking the mirror of reality down, smashing into pieces before the screen goes black into the next slide.
 Transitional Slide - Clearance sale: 100% off PART 2: For Sale 
Scene 1: The Dunk
A symbolistic baptism that takes Kendrick under thats meant to cleanse him from his impurities and sins of the night to be reborn again. This scene is a complete contrast from Scene 2 which compliments to criticism of the hip hop industry in For Sale.
 Transitional Slide - Life is like a box of chickens
 Transitional Slide - Instagram 2016: Dussy unlimited
 Transitional Slide - If I blame you for a loss, I’ll be giving you all the credit
 Transitional Slide - Good dussy can make you melt
Scene 2: Lust
Lucys temptations are all around Kendrick whether its smoking weed, making him famous or filling his pockets with money these comparisons are depicted through the naked women in scene.
 Transitional Slide - Always trust a n with cornrows
Scene 3: Lost/Distractions
It seems like Kendrick is trying to keep focus and maintain what is important to him, looking unaware and lost he is staring into the same place not noticing the women and putting aside these distractions. Transitional Slide - Time is change, your friend or foe
 Transitional Slide - Never trust a n with too many haircuts
 Transitional Slide - Tracee Ellis Ross is vibrant
Scene 4: Demonic Eyes
Seducing Kendrick into these sinful acts seeming to illustrate a lucifer idea or connection - depicted through the lighting, eyes and the heads tilt provides an uncomfortable mood for the audience.Scene 5: Upside Down
Conscious speaking Transitional Slide - I made money, I lost money, I did it again
 Transitional Slide - Dussy salary cap
 Transitional Slide - Water dawg
 Transitional Slide - I followed your rules for way too long
 Transitional Slide - Night like this I wish that bomb head would fall
Scene 6: Bridge
This scene makes little sense in the film and stands out like a sore thumb and really questions the audience about what is happening.
Scene 7: Trapped
How the industry strips you down for what you have got like strippers and take your money and keep you trapped in their vicious cycle. Transitional Slide - My tastebloods is expensive
Scene 8: Waking up
Waking up out of it? To reality since it can be so consuming like the big screen Transitional Slide - You played the game, I pimped it
 Transitional Slide - God is gangsta
Scene 9: Drowning to being brought back
After the extended drowning.. longer time under sins.Scene 10: Unexpected bridge cut
 Transitional Slide - Fin

Ahhh! Ahhh!
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
Lucifer was all around
So I kept running
Until I found my safe haven
I was trying to convince myself the stripes I got
Making myself realize what my foundation was
But while my loved ones were fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Ay on my momma, nigga 
Imma be the greatest to ever do this shit
On my momma, doe like...
On the dead homies
Aye Sounwave turn this shit up nigga
Turn this shit up! Soundwave, turn this shit up nigga

But homicide be lookin at you from the face down
What Mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin, and let me tell you bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows

Reapin everything I sow, so my karma come
And heaven no preliminary hearing, so my record

Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon be alright
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin me is complicated
Too afraid, a lot of changes
Im alright, and youre a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didnt wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
I need a rider
To go down and slide up
I hope you can handle a shift stick, babe
Cause you gotta drive it 
Girl, dont try to fight it

Boy, you tryna give that pussy new interior design
Bangin, bangin, wake up in it, Ima put my back into it
No Netflix, we makin movies, Ima let you watch me do it

To go down and slide up

You love the way I grind on that dick, grind on that dick
Yeah, climb on that dick, glide on that dick
Big titties in the front seat, ass in the back
Throw it like a pitcher, baby, hit it with your bat
 I be on that freak shit
 Bust it for no reason
I need a rider
To go down and slide up
I hope you can handle a shift stick, babe
Cause you gotta drive it 
Girl, dont try to fight it
When Im all up inside it 
You shiftin the gears on my stick shift, babe
You got me excited

Oh, let me bang it, oh, let me bang it out
I bet you ride, yeah
Sometimes I want to leave, sometimes I want to cry
Sometimes I hate to bear the truth, sometimes I want to lie
Sometimes I want to school the youth, sometimes I want to ride
Sometimes I want to not think, sometimes I want to vibe
Sometimes I want to bump Tribe and zone out
This songs bout a young boy thats gone wild inside
When my world collide
With your world where your girl and your kids reside
We killed the facades, we feel free to fly
Were birds that reserve in the charismatic sky
I care about my pride too much
If my clothes is new, if my ride is plush
If my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed
I look in the mirror, Im trendy enough? Wrong
Insecurity roams the black community
Homes where kids must have jewelry
The high school female need earrings and details
So she can be cool to be, amongst popularity
The various name brands that reached the price scan
Its not about the right price but more like the right scam
To rule us all, confuse us all
Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw
Now lets draw
The picture of a rapper with a chain and Range that is not paid for
My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house
That lives around his neck like a white collar
So why fast forward? then Ill rewind, a time machine can help me double back to slavery times
Picking cotton from a field that a white man own
The blacker you are, farther youre from the white mans home
Negro spiritual songs, gave us some type of sanity
Before your vanity, they parted our families
They put us in hundred degree shade and outside we bathed
The more we were afraid, the more they made rules
And trapped our minds in a cage, our freedom was so vague
Couldnt see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross 
And school was exempt, see we couldnt have smarts
And a smirk could get you hurt, wounded first from a scar
400 years of nothing, 400 years of suffering
400 years of tears, and tribulations, miseducation
See what we facing is now coming back to the roots
Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot
Called us niggers and figured that we never live in pursuit
Of happiness, we capture these feelings in things that we do
Thought of abstinence of slavery but we made it come to
About a perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie
Her hand bag gotta be Gucci, its fake then she fool me
She still bad though, and her fake Gucci aint that bad though
We filling up the gas for Rollies
Upgrade to 26s after riding Kobes
My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya
He overcompensates for the life of his ancestors
So blame it on the 400 years we never saw
The reason why the next 400 we gotta floss
Slaves
I said the 400 years we never had nothing
Barely had clothes on our back
Is the reason why when we get a little bit of change
We over exaggerate on our living expenses
So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house
Youre a vanity slave
If youre a female and you got 4,5,6 rings on your finger
Four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing
Youre a vanity slave
If you got an 02 Monte Carlo with 24s on it
And on the back of the window it says, Get on my level ho
Youre a vanity slave
Were all vanity slaves, and with that being said
Can somebody please tell me where the mall at?
Im not from around here, hey Ali, where we at? Idaho?
Yeah nigga, you know the first of the month, checks coming in
Im tryna get some

Owe her a hunnid favors, I call her my hunnid proof

High speed
All gold
Lord of the Ring
We live that life big time
Big time
A hunnid times I gave my bitch the sunshine
Harley Davis

You was a college student abusing the credit union
The music was way too loud, the tuition was fuckin stupid
And me I was runnin wild hittin licks in my mothers Buick
Confusing, you like my style even though I was broke and doing
Stick em ups, you wanna pick em up
Inside your Civic Plus the difference was
I wasnt rich as fuck you still would depend on us
And I missed the crush that we had every time winter December come
And we had tempers and arguments, disagreements and senses from
Cupid himself, and Im shootin himself
And the paramedics wont come even if you scream for help
Dont let love die, you regroovin yourself
And Im losing now too looking at you boo hoo from whats dealt
So as I reminisce the coupon that we used to split at Rallys
On your mothers couch your little brother in the alley
You say K. Dot your page got that pay that Birdman and Jay got
One day youll reap what you sow, now I reap for us both
Thats one hunnid
Now I’m sitting here sippin on the last bit of vodka
And all I ever see is your face
And I be sitting here thinking bout the shit that you’ve been doing
And all I know is I owe you a
Hunnid, hunnid, a hunnid favors
Ill do you a hunnid favors
Hunnid, hunnid, a hunnid favors
Yeah
And now I’m sitting here sippin on the last bit of GT
And all I ever see is your face
A hunnid favors
Ohh, nothing less
Hunnid, hunnid

We all know opposite attract, like a rail road, and I like
You to do anything you please when youre with me, momma
Lets head home, crack a bottle of the Sutter Homes
And hit some trees, why not?
Where your head at?
Hope its in the gutter like mine, not where you find rats
Talking bout where you find ecstasy
Come on have a little bit of sex with me
Can I hit it in the morning, til the sun has fallen
Like a new born, baby you stallin
You know you want all this long dick
Oh shit, might want to make you my misses like I lost it
Peek-a-boo
Lady your smile light up the room, Pikachu
You could put a nigga in a tomb peek-at-you
Lets pop this cork, let me rub on your neck
Til Victorias secret get all wet
And Victorias secret safe with me
Let Victorias secret leave your legs
I know you had a hard day, baby, relax your mind
Shit, soon as Christ turned water into wine, everything was fine
When things get hard to swallow, we need a bottle of Moscato
Puts me in the mood for your loving, you love it
We can even do it tomorrow, just bring a bottle of Moscato
Puts me in the mood for your loving
You love it
Guess whose back in this motherfucka
Looking like a motherfuckin Chi-town pimp, alright
Make my money flip, make my money flip
Make my money flip, I been in the gym all night
Came in the game with a dollar and a dream
And a AK clip with an infrared beam
I pop that trunk, make everybody scream
Put a missing punk on everybodys screen
Aint nothing changed but the ends Im holding
My dick is big and my nuts is swollen
I dont know if youve noticed but a nigga be rolling
With a bad bitch and the bitch be rolling
Dolphin pills and Moscato spills
Everything she need to get her thrill
No Hennessy on the bartender bill
Just good wine and a good place to chill
I feel I might get loose tonight and fuck your girlfriend
I mean I feel she might come through tonight, plus her girlfriend
In a 5-Star suite with a 5-Star freak
Slinging that dick while baby eat
On her punani, ooh mommys, look at yours bodies, Im geeked
Having a good time
Put my pain in a mothafuckin bottle
A chain and a diamond ring dont feel the same
If a nigga aint got his eyes closed 
I know you had a hard day baby, relax your mind
Shit, soon as Christ turned water into wine everything was fine
When things get hard to swallow, we need a bottle of Moscato
Puts me in the mood for your loving, you love it
We can even do it tomorrow, just bring a bottle of Moscato
Puts me in the mood for your loving
You love it
I said, its a celebration, clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp with a glass of Moscato
What up ho, what up?
I said what up ho, what up?
I said, its a celebration, clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp with a glass of Moscato
What up ho, what up?
I said what up ho, what up?
Sip slow
Relaxation
Thats our motto

My biggest fear is going broke
Cant say no, thats my problem
I wanted that Rolls-Royce
Young boy looking to make a bad choice
Then it got fucked up when mom went to jail
I heard a little voice
Back of my head, Back of my mind
Dropped out of school but a nigga did fine
I aint telling you to drop out, but if you do make use of your time

Im looking at fixtures that I dont remember
Im all in my zone, Karl Malone
Taking these shots, abusing my liver
Its mine, I spend it
Its mine, Im gon spend it
Doomsday, Dooms date
These niggas weak like its a tuesday
Niggas get loony like a toon stay
Everything well done, like two steaks
Who they? aint from L.A
They fall off like November days
They worry bout your sales
But, at the end the day, who getting paid?
I said why they hating on me Im just trying to get my guap
Im just trying to set my family up
First: believe in one God then stack your paper higher

At the end of it all
No one wants to drink alone
Baby, thats how it goes
Dont walk away from me
Fragmented memories
Sentences incomplete
Thats when she said
Dont wanna put up a fight anymore
Im down to the end of my rope
And Im freefalling
Ill search inside myself
I need to know why I act this way
A whisper turns to a scream
I cant ignore it no more
At the end of it all
No one wants to drink alone
Baby, thats how it goes
From my eyewitness binoculars 
To Argentina and Africa 
We mastered the pressure 
Hazardous , harassing us 
You laugh at us 
More accurate at bagging dimes, now we bagging rhymes
Bodybags, price tags on your forehead
Nine times out of ten, young niggas are nine or ten
When the line becomes thin: be a killer or fireman
Fill up the lavish pen if I needed to right my wrongs
I cant deny sin, condolences through these palms
I remember when your cousin was coming home
My bitch, why we plotted to kill him cause we aint know him
Unfamiliar faces make niggas nervous
Convicted court cases might hit the surface
Restricted territories might come through lurkin
We aint want none of that urgent call
Well, Ima act Turk and fall on my identity, percocets
For all the headaches, Im bout to bring confetti
Tumble out this barrel soon as it ring, you ready?
That was the word for we moved on em
Treat him like Joe the Plumber
I wonder if someone come and can see this tool on him
Immature and retarded is what you call me
Your cousin want coming home from the pen but from the army
If I can right my wrongs and pen this verse I read
Even though a bullet hit him in the leg, still walk on by
At the end of it all
No one wants to drink alone
Baby thats how it goes
Dont walk away from me
I remember, uhh
When my uncles
Served smokers
On Alondra
In front of our building, they was my heroes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Uhh, and thats scary to me
Dope beat, dope flow, vary to me
Especially when Sounwave is on his Ps
Nigga cue me in Im a Peruvian drug lord
Dont fast forward, Ima serve you some keys
This is crack co-caine, Im Kurt Co-bain
And I bang like a C-R-I-P
P-I-R-U, high you Im a I-V
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack— STOP
I said a I-V cuz when I be in the studio, I shot
A needle in your veins, take it in vein
Or itch till your eyeballs pop
Im cold on the cold turkey
I hate chickens but I do fuck pretty birdies
Where your girl at? Over the Pyrex, where my world at
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Uhh, and its scary to me
Every listener is a strawberry to me
You pussies aint shit but venereal disease
Zs on K.Dot? Uh-uh better wake up
A nightmare, Im right there like a Siamese
-Twin, when, you mothafuckas gon learn?
Curl up like Big Worm when I drop
Who fly? Im a red eye with eye drops
I Big, I Pac, you Chris, I Rock
Thats Pookie on New Jack head first with a cyclops
Im the first one to do that I bet you never knew that
Back like a tailbone, who you got to tell on?
If ain’t about me about ho it be about face
If you ain’t on higher—learning
Theres soda in the pot and the fire—burning
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Uhh, and its scary to carry
A smooth type flow like a drink of Merlot
Thatll freak yall out like a girl Virgo
When I turbo on any track, its a Reynolds wrap
And I rap like a nigga who invented rap
Rapping heat, you can fall to defeat
If you dont pay ya tolls like the limbs on ya feet
I suppose this is bigger than life
This is probably everybody, Illuminati
Guess Im the blood sacrifice of the party
I undress her like a Harley
Lights will flash, cars will crash
Smoke more junk while the junkies laugh
So my bad if I put you in rehab
You are reimbursed, put it on my tab
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Aw dude, youre about to fuckin OD bro
24/7, 365, motherfucker Im still right on time
Oh you thought you had me all figured out?
Take it from the horses mouth, youll never understand me
I told you my Plan B is to win your hearts before we win a Grammy
These Days aint shit changed, different toilet, same shit
And I drank a whole gallon of laxatives by accident
Just to shit on you has-beens
Had it been for my past tense, I wouldnt be rapping
See these streets made me, broke me down
Built me up, drove me crazy
Made me hungry, made you hate me, but fuck love
It dont make dollars, it dont make sense nigga
By the way, thats DJ Quik nigga, respect or check it
These days, Im a little more focused
Cause yall cracked the door and I kicked it open
Yellin get the fuck down or I will shoot
I told you not to motherfuckin move!
Be another example
Ill take the whole industry hostage if I have to
Ill sabotage this game, a good kid?
Yeah thats only in my mamas eyes
I seen a dead body at five and that shit made me traumatized
So These Days, a little blood on my hands aint nothing compared
To hopping out a minivan, with a mini 22 3s and the homie TuTu
And two more YGs, oh nobody got time for that!
These Days its only time for rap!
So Herbert Anthony Stevens
You make or break bread before we break even
Before they broke our records we broke records
And wrote pieces, of history
So These Days? These accolades thats meant for we?
Its only truth that this shit was meant to be, T.D.E
Lifes still a Traffic Jam 
Lifes still a Traffic Jam 
Lifes still a Traffic Jam 
Lifes still a Traffic Jam 
Lifes still a Traffic Jam 
Lifes still a Traffic Jam 
Lifes still a Traffic Jam
Lifes still a Traffic Jam...
Shit... what more did you expect? HiiiPower
For the most part, we go hard for the respect
Im obviously ominous to my competition
And if I aint better than Kendrick than nobody is then!
We shared our life with you
Shared our light with you even in the darkest of hours
In hopes that one day, just maybe, one day the worldll be ours
Ha, and now they look up to us like towers
For rhyming like we had super powers
They shouldve never let us in these offices...
Knowing good and God-damn well
How well weve been ducking officers
Laughing at the scraps they offered us in the past
And now we toast champagne to the thirst we never had!
I had my ups and downs, but I always left right
Rest In Peace Alori Joh... TopDawg for life!
And oh yeah... SOUL!
I watch that fire that were gathered around and see that it burns similar to the fire that is inside you...
Only go backwards, lately
Every part of me says, Go ahead
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling
And well be screamin out no rules, no rules
Feel the energy we go through, I told you
Pump my fist like Im supposed to, I showed you
My vision of the unsocial, its so cool
Look around me and youll see the scene, who to blame?
See my generation has no shame, I play the game
How I see it this is inside the future, this is nothin that youre used to
I refuse to play the victim, my religion is to move ya
Out your power position, my army head-on collision
Cant harm me out of my own skin, government need assistance
Every time that I zone in, nothing is more convincin
Than tellin you that I wont bend, break or fake partition
I cant, this is my life design, this is me taking mines
This is what I live for, this is me takin yours
This is more than C4, this is what happens when
We ready to build and destroy, I hope that you enjoy
It feels like I only go backwards, lately
Every part of me says, Go ahead
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling
I live my life a rebel, a vigilante, devils try to get at me
Pedal through this underworld, undertakers wont catch me
System aint no system for justice if you would ask me
Ill tell you everything is corrupted, dont you walk past me
With the condescended look I can tell youre pretendin
Like you my friends and you just a henchman, I feel relentless
I feel the tension in the air thick enough to cut through it
Or cut you with it, Im cut from a cloth that bred a nuisance
Trespass on your property I am properly aimin to go against ya democracy
This is me changing faces cause I can stand alone and die alone as long as I got pride
The victory of fight is all in my eyes
The night is young and I can see your demise, Im waitin for it
You can’t ignore it, you live dormant, I die enormous
Big as the lies you tell I can tell that you feel defeated
The truth will set you free and to me thats the only reason, capisce?
It feels like I only go backwards, lately
Every part of me says, Go ahead
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling
It feels
Look inside my eyes and tell me you see a warrior
I never felt the feeling of euphoria
Pain forever or prolong the pros and cons of prosperity is strong
Wake up in the morning and I gotta win
Not taking the victory, thats my only sin
And so I send a message to your messenger
A warning shot to let em know Im serious
Im ready for a war, when I roar it can break a glass window
The only thing for sure: the perfect way to bend you
On your back even if I gotta slither through the cracks
I can crack every code you deliver, I attack
Every hole where the bomb squad sit it on the tripod
Even if you try hard, he can still die hard
Run but you cant hide: white flags
You can pull em out fast and tell me your last goodbye
I will, I will climb the highest mountain
Before the flood comes
And all my fight is drowning in blood
What I got to lose? What I got to prove?
I guess war is my love
Make sure your next move is slick, your best move is nothing
You know I take risk: dark clouds, I love it
Cause I can hide in the mist, hop out
And crush every soldier youre with, so Im 6 for 6
Im sick with determination: Ill terminate ya quick
I lead the pack, I follow no rules
I see the traps, I know youre close to
Falling on your face, unload, reload
Hand me another case, explode, explode
The fire of my eyes is waiting on your demise
I know you hope your help is close by
I will, I will climb the highest mountain
Before the flood comes
And all my fight is drowning in blood
What I got to lose? What I got to prove?
I guess war is my love
Our circumstance to where we had parents in our lives that was showing us everything
Like didnt nobody walk us and— by our hand and show us like you do this and dont do that
It wasnt like that coming up in our motherfuckin community where we grew up at
We grew up off of, what? Figueroa, nigga, like a, a, a, a worldwide blade
A real strip 
A real, real ho store
I mean, you know like
You got a mama tellin you somethin and a daddy
A daddy tellin you somethin
And at the same time, you got your daddy, he, he, he, he around the corner
Gettin high off the heroin
Your mama on the county, you know what I mean? Like
Supportin, wanna take care of ten kids
I mean, you know, man, its like
Smokin the gas on the regular, man, you know what I mean?
Word
Sippin on Henn, nothin but regular, you know what I mean?
Word, uh
Pissy sofas, sharin food with roaches, uh
On gangster Crip, my papa was a bitch
Left me where hope just dont exist
And every neighbor got a fence
With bars on windows, my moms slavin for the rent
Throwin dices, GT Dyno groovin
Where you hang, we shootin
You slip, you stiffen
Creative Crippin, uh
Nigga, uh
Bitches stop in traffic
This that type of shit that make the MAC a classic
Reason Im pussy magnet
She learned to carry package
I been the best at rappin, uh
Im hot as Vegas
Your favorite rapper broke, he dont get this paper
But claim he got a kilo, been born in 93, though
He tryna fool the people
Man
The jokes on you, motherfucker
The loc is on you, motherfucker
I warned you, its karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, its karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, its karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, its karma
Aint nothin changed but the change
Lets put our brains away from gangs
Crips and Bloods the old and new slaves
Shit, we even changed our names
Tiny somethin, Lil Shane, while we bang
But yo, yall aint hearin me
My homie facin life, he told me that my pride my biggest enemy
But you keep your eyes in that dark
Your mind, it grays your heart
I wrote these rhymes days apart
Most of us caught before we can expand our thoughts
How your grandmother see your corpse?
How your big homie make your life a book?
Left you for dead cause he aint lead you right
But Im gon freedom write, hmm
Lets put the rags down and raise our kids
Lets put the guns down and blaze a spliff
Lets do it now, man, no buts or ifs
It took a Blood to get me Pringle chips
You can learn to fly or take the ladder
Real nigga shit, all lives matter, both sides
Man
The jokes on you, motherfucker
The loc is on you, motherfucker
I warned you, its karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, its karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, its karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, its karma
My back against the wall, like I see yall fronting
Drowning in your own spit and aint coming up with nothing
I call this shit Rapper Shit cause I aint a rapper
But if I was, this aint some shit that I could rap after
Caught up in the rapture, you call yourself a factor
Youre lame, paving a way Bob could build faster
Im a real master, real massive, you just real average
I see your chain, its strange, they wore those in the Middle Passage
And its harder to play me than to fiddle backwards
Dont act like you knew my tactics
Cause when it hits the fan, you know I stand last
I see through your true colors like stained glass
I see the fear in your eyes when we arrive
And whats the odds of even thinking you coincide
When every time a nigga open a door you go inside
Just to realize, either youre weak or someone lied
See, you spend more time boasting about what you do than you do
So by the time your shit is due its doo-doo
And who knew that too cool fool who used to sit in the back
Would slip through the crack, like dudes who went to rehab
Ab-Soul, Abstract Asshole
Black Lip Bastard, et cetera for forever
I follow no ruler, even if Im under a drastic measure
But whatever
They say pressure bust pipes
And I aint never had to deal with plumbing in my life, now thats a bar
Sparring with me like blasphemy to cathedral
Or colliding with the diesel with your baby in your arms
You would test me but you know better
Its inadequate to go against the Jesus of Nazareth
Of the rap game, and guess what, I got no cheddar
But my mind is like a wizard
I defy the laws of gravity every time I get high and write a sentence
Back teeth never been in agony, but I got wisdom
I have risen from the wicked to jump on the competition, Scorch ya, third degree burns next to their sideburns,
All sorts of combustible flows, firemen on speed dial
Free the leaders of the free world with a freestyle
Free the teachers, black activists get up off your feet now
And feed off my feelings
As I control my wheel like new power steering, so sincere
Tryna duck court hearings but I got big ears
Rap peers, used to study them wishing they would fuck with me
Now they cant fuck with him, Im wishing good luck to them
Reluctantly these critics loving me and I dont blame em
They say, Kendrick you gunning for these niggas
So when I pull my weapon out, I give em the pleasure to see me aim it
And watch these bullets run into these niggas, clear the set
I got now, I got next, give you nouns, give you verbs
Give you adjectives while proposing an agitated threat
I am most debated in barber shops all because they slept on me
Big homie fear young, buck cause when I buck I make more than a buck
Dollars come quick like a fucking nun fucking for the first time
Put me in Alaska for six months in the dark, in my heart I know sun still shine
Still got a skill to be found in a gold mine
I got an appetite for habitual liars on the mic
Who with pliers couldnt get a grip on life
I spit like I sat the tip of my dick on ice, and thats intense
Imagine if I had already came twice, aint that some shit
Pass the swisher nigga, fill your cup with liquor nigga
Fly your kite till youre gone till November nigga
Show em you remember nigga
Pour some Hennessy and Crown for your homie six feet underground
Smoke an ounce and turn that frown upside down
Like the triangle in the panties of my gal
When Mike Jack made Raining in Moscow I had no style
Tommy Boy stocking on my scalp
And that was like ninety-five, now its twenty-ten
Two years away from when they say the worlds expected to end
And I aint even begin
Thats more ironic than a bum asking for 50 Cent from Many Men, one
Too many relays for DJs to replay
I do the reject while I eject your new singlay
Hot enough to sit in hell, then unveil in heatwave
Piss on a demon with ice water
And if I lose my voice then Im probably calling out to all P.A
Systems to assist in with the word Im tryna spread
Like county jail bread or the legs of a hoochie
And thats off top like a toupee, Im 2Pac
Coming back for doomsday, spitting at cops, go and cop my album
Get high to it, pop some valium, then turn up the volume
I influence ghettos where it says caution
And them bloggers get to sparking like L.A. females thats balling
Round the time this happens often, the violence get the flare
We racing against life, the turtle or the hare?
And nobody can compare to the legacy that we bout to build
Yall work at Build-A-Bear soft as underhand pitching with skills
Shit, and aint no use in crying over spilt milk
Youre dead and gone
The pall-bearers carry you and your family will carry on
And on the real, this aint a construction site but you know the drill
We lead the league in all aspects
And we deserve more medals than a magnet
Put you niggas in a hole like bad debt
Shooting three pointers with the globe, nothing but nets
Nigga, nothing but the best
Every time we hit your tape deck niggas hit the deck
I rhyme like a fucking TEC-9,
And I Clown Posses if they disrespect
You looking at a T-Rex snapping at em with Tourettes
Yeah, this the flow that killed aspiring rappers
Too late, I grab the eight and start expiring rappers
Some shit only BIG and Pac could rap after
And if they was alive, they would have to pay tithes
I am God
M.C.R. squares will disperse in despair, this is me motherfucker
Tell to myself, still on fire
Im under attack, but Im still on fire
I got some chatter, but Im still on fire
I got some threat, but Im still on fire
I got some liabilities, but Im still on fire
If its not amazing that Im on fire
Ive been to hell and back, but Im still on fire
Whats in the back of my mind, sittin in the back of that thang
With the two double R sittin in the back of my brain
Anywhere but here, thats what I told my chauffeur
And this shit gettin heavy, weight of the world on my shoulders
Think you figured it out, but you dont have a clue
Think you on top of the world but the world on top of you
I started hustlin for draws and now theres plaques on the walls
Think Im sellin my soul? Then you can come get em all
Trade em all for my dawgs, yea, Im talkin to you
Where did we go wrong? Because I dont have a clue
You just wanna hit the mall and buy a new pair of shoes
But its real consequences nigga remember the rules
So I regret the day you ever serve that nigga
Took 5 years of your life, you didnt deserve that nigga
I guess power and pain look its somewhat the same
I lost my dawg to the fame, I charge it all to the game
Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And aint nobody gave us nothin, so we drug dealin
You know we coppin Louie loafers just to thug in em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
I said we came so far but yet it feel so surreal
Hood nigga, half a mili, automobile
Im talkin real luxury, dont feel a bump in the road
We aint like the rest of these niggas that fall out over hoes
Thought you my nigga forever, thought that you could be trusted
Man I found out you takin it, really had me disgusted
Nigga, who am I kiddin? It felt like a heart attack
Cause I gave you my heart and didnt ask for it back
And to be honest with you, I really thought we were brothers
Fuck everyone in this world as long as we got each other
Woulda done anything, took a trafficking charge
Everyday on my head just to see you livin large
Gangster pitted it kills, gave you your first mill
And I aint tell you to blow it, I aint tell you to throw it
You fell a victim to pressure, yea, I know it can stress ya
But youre only a man, homie, I aint mad at ya
Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And aint nobody gave us nothin, so we drug dealin
You know we coppin Louie loafers just to thug in em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
I swear the Lord is my shepherd, Im bout to go cop a Lexus
Im bout to go fuck Alexis, take this and flood my Rolexes
This black on black is a blessin
Black on black crime on my weapon
I protect mine on my mama and em, these my Usher confessions
Let it burn - Tee-Tee and Tiana sexting
Teepees and mansions I rest in
Two Ts and Top Dawg impress with
TVs that play their investment
K-D-O-T go tee off and TGs and YGs gon press it
Its our turn - I pray that I never lose you
Cause I like Benji and beaucoup bucks at my wrists
They do voodoo, curse you forever, you better not touch it
The clutching Im used to, 250 speed racing crucial
Nigga, Vrrrrm
My youngins asking me do you consider role models useful
Its hard to say when Im neutral, Im tryna find out myself
Find inner peace inside heaven, find diamond piece inside hell
Will I learn
Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And aint nobody gave us nothin, so we drug dealin
You know we coppin Louie loafers just to thug in em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He’s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I been through
We the last real niggas alive, that’s official
Let me tell you when it all started
Game dropped Documentary and made plenty enemies
It was a classic album, but prior to that
Guerilla Black debuted and put the city on wax
A lot of Biggie comparisons, we all was aware of them
But that wasnt my M.O., I just thought he was dope
Cant understand why Game would say his name in that manner
Many years went by, still no legitimate answer
Anyway, I put out a mixtape in 12th grade
Hub City threat, minor of the year, DJ Dave
And his brother designed, put together the music
Put it out to the people, the people said I was stupid
With the flow, went to the barbershop to show off my skills
Mike and Himey and some other cat said I was real
Himey was Games barber, the other cat made a statement
Saying that Game was his partner, so I gave him my tape
Said hed play it for him, hoping that Id get my big break
But never got a response.. anyway
This nigga named Pop Gates came to my school with a camera
I freestyled on his DVD for a minute then after
It hit the streets, I was known as K. Dot from Compton
Man Hootie probably was the youngest out that was poppin
But I didnt have a home yet, Hootie had ? in me
Until I met Top Dawg, told Dave that hed like to meet
Me at the studio, made me freestyle for an hour
Told me come back tomorrow, but I came back in a hour
Jay Rock was in the booth, recording his first mixtape
Was skeptical homie at first because he knew where I stayed
But we got over that, heard the beat, wrote a rap
Did our first collaboration on the Nephew track
He got signed months later, Warner Brothers
We started on his album, he wrote his rhymes on paper
Before Sidekicks became a modern day phone
Same time our buzz was generated from G Malone
He had a song called 200, White Lightnin, the streets loved it
Said that Sony had gave him an unbelievable budget
Now thats a smart nigga, Im tryna make my raps bigger than life
But not knowing how to market it right
Turned on the radio
Only cat new from the West Coast was playin was Bishop
And by then this nigga buzz was tremendous
In the lab, me and Rock tryna perfect our craft
What the fuck? Next thing you know, we came across Lift Me Up
It was a hit
When I heard it
But all we had was the instrumental and the hook
But when
Rock jump on it for certain, it was to smash
Gave it to Julio, just to get his opinion
Next thing you know, the record was
Spinning
That was a good look, it set the coast on fire
Niggas in Garden projects presents Watts Riot
Then these rappers start hating, callin up to the station
Ask why they record aint playin, what you niggas complaining, about?
Shit was funny to us tho
Niggas hate to see a nigga from the bottom come up, yo
In the midst of the single poppin and niggas tryna seek and destroy
I had a situation with Def Jam, premature
Shit went sour after Jay-Z left but they didnt care
I was glad Jay-Z gave me respect
See I was young, fast forward, hot dollah had the streets on lock
Far as radio play, obvious, he got a lot
Beefing’ with Daz Dilinger, Jay Rock spoke on it
Which in my opinion, I didn’t think the shit was impo’tant
But that’s a whole ‘nother story, we hit the lab with Game
And a few other names like Juice and Young, ya boy
Did the cypher freestyle and everybody’s like, Wow
These Top Dawg niggas ‘bout to make noise
Surely after Game took us on tour, I love you for that
But right after that, we didn’t see him no more
G Malone came with a smash hit with Akon
Mistah FAB battled Royce Nickel with napalm
Then everybody start to scream out the new West
And claim that West Coast legends don’t want to see him at best
I think that’s just an excuse, because their music aint tight
Tell ‘em that Ab-soul said it, they can quote him twice
Then Crooked I came with Hip-Hop Weekly, killin’ the internet
But he been a threat since Deathrow, then Roccett came about
And all I thought about was Ab-Soul 2Eleven too
It finally started to look like the West was makin’ moves
Western Union had the whole block boomin’ because of Snoop
Matter fact, Bad Lucc was my favorite about the group
Then ?Problem? took off, another Compton native
We both Compton niggas, but Compton still aint made it
By this time, Jay Rock and All My Life hit the airwaves
We almost got into some major beef over Lil’ Wayne
That part Imma leave out
Theres certain things that the streets only should know about
Shout out to Nipsey
Bishop win that game, then had a fight with X.O
That’s when I dropped C4 and had the critics mad at me
Because they didn’t see my views, grab the hottest album out and re-do it
That’s a goddamn power move stupid
You foolish, don’t know shit about this war shit
Theres mo’ shit to wanting to be the king of the coast shit
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He’s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I been through
We the last real niggas alive, that’s official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He’s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I been through
We the last real niggas alive, that’s official
So two weeks ago I finally run into the nigga I gave my mixtape too
And said he was partners with Game
The nigga finally told me what he said
He said he didn’t like it
But the niggas like
“See, see, look at you, look at you now, I tried to tell him you was tight”
Nigga probably never even gave it to him and shit
Ah, ah
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you aint shit, feel like you dont feel
Confidence in yourself, breakin on marble floors
Watchin anonymous strangers, tellin me that Im yours
But you aint shit, Im convinced your tolerance nothin special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
Situations, Ill start with your little sister bakin
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas?
Where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
I fuckin tell you, you fuckin failure—you aint no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you—I dont need you!
The world dont need you, dont let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, thats for dedication
Thought money would change you
Made you more complacent
I fuckin hate you, I hope you embrace it
I swear—
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Lovin you, lovin you, not lovin you, 100° proof
I can feel your vibe and recognize that youre ashamed of me
Yes, I hate you, too
House keeping
House keeping
¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
¡Disculpe!
You the reason why mama and them leavin
No, you aint shit, you say you love them
I know you dont mean it
I know youre irresponsible, selfish, in denial, you cant help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence?
Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple
You ain’t no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit
Or leave his best friend, little brother
You promised you’d watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas?
On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTimed him one time, thats unforgiven
You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought he would recover well
Third surgery, they couldnt stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, You fuckin failed
You aint try
Oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh, ohh
Whats wrong, nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta
I thought this what you wanted
They say if you scared, go to church
But remember, he knows the Bible too
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
Ima go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin, poking that doja til Im idle with you
Cause I 
Now, baby, when Im riding here, Im riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin, drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
Cause I 
I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
You looked me in my eyes about four, five times
Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified
That I 
You said Sherane aint got nothing on Lucy
I said, You crazy?
Roses are red, violets are blue
But me and you both pushing up daisies if I 
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
Ima go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin, poking that doja til Im idle with you
You said to me
You said your name was Lucy
I said, Wheres Ricardo?
You said, Oh, no, not the show
Then you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned twenty-six, I was like, Oh, shit
You said to me
I remember what you said too, you said
My name is Lucy, Kendrick
You introduced me, Kendrick
Usually I don’t do this
But I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries
Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon fill your pockets
Lucy gon move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty
Avoiding me?
Its not so easy, Im at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy dont slack a minute
Lucy work harder
Lucy gon call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
Im Lucy
I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy dont mind, cause at the end of the day youll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract if that’s possible
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
Ima go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin, poking that doja til Im idle with you
Cause I 
Now, baby, when Im riding here, Im riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin, drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
Cause I

Kites on my radar, life in my palms
We unite through the chaos 
Tell them to obey ours
My cerebellum threw a rebellion from ARs
The day I have a J.R., I tell him to work for God only
And quit his day job 
Radio never play ours
This revolution aint televised with prayer
Jumping over borders 
Aint no ruler for restrictions, aint no police to deport us 
Aint no summers for our sons, aint no dealings for our daughters 
Every prosecution hung, save the verdict for the lawyers 
Illuminate the corner , celebrate humanity
And scream back at me in the morning 
Every field in Mississippi, every street in California 
Know the devil is a liar, its the time to be anointed 
Truck into a stream, disconnected to a dream
Head bussin, hittin nothing, even if I gotta bleed
Sittin waiting patient for a universal pain
Politicking with the nation, this is big as you and me huh?
I let you find my contacts, okay
Tryna set us off for combat, no way
Waking up the spirit its on every human being
If you with us, then you scream so one day you can shine way out!
Me, Im way, way out
Way out, way out
Way, way, way out
Hey, hey
Wanna bring the fucking crayon
Hey, hey

We wanna get a job as a baroness
They dont want no goddamn foreigners!
Say, Hey, you, you wanna marry us?
Carriers the cross, they carry us
I wanna get high cause Im curious
Im serious, I hope you are feeling us 
Im paying all these with periods 
With mobiles are running delirious 
Its our dream, out of this radius 
Im lettin off kites to the barriers 
Im lettin off kites to the barriers 
Im lettin off kites to the barriers 
Let-let-letttin off kites to the barriers 
Theres room for so many more

I used to call me Waldo, and now they call me Walter
Yeah, Im higher than them Urkel pants
Live without a purpose, man but that just cause my circumstances
And I mean it, if you want it, come and get it, boy
Death come in threes and you’re looking like triplets boys
In high school I climbed the roof so I could smoke my weed
The dealers knew that I was young and sold me bag of seeds
I’m chasing dreams, hoes chasing me
But I just get they name and number like the maître d
‘cause all I wanna do was roll up hash and smash the ass of a bitch who live like Kim Kardashian
All the spoons in my kitchen
Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down
All the girls in my bedroom
They bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I
Bend, I bend, I bend, I bend
Bend it girl, bend it girl
She is the last straw, I’ve bend her then sip slow
My pencil draws her closer, she gets high and bends low
Long flight from my Cali mistress, to a district with red lights
Prostitutes and rich niggas, just a recipe for long nights
Shake well, and all they do
I’m laying next to some girl who last night showed me things I never knew
Either I’m bending space out or I’m just bending space in
I put my heart on tracks, but it’s four AM and that chick’s still racing
One bed, two girls, three way, four times
My shame came off with their clothes, it’s paradise of the mind
Absolut vodka mixed with absolute freedom
I meet my darker side and it’s a pleasure just to meet him
I’m thinking about puffing and writing while fucking
Yesterday’s gone and tomorrow ain’t comin
And if tomorrow ain’t comin and that’s the name that she told me
But when you hit this level, every first name is phony
But here, the air tastes better
Weed is more potent and girls seem wetter
Days are a haze and drinks just stronger
Nocturnal nigga, these nights seem longer
I’m only here for one night, it’s Disneyland for man
White girls, blue kush, red lights, American in Amster…damn
Its like I dont think you fully understand who I am, ya know?
Im just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap
I dont represent no colors, I represent my lil sisters and brothers
Im the oldest, nigga
And if you cant respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Check it out
I used to wanna rap like JAY-Z
Until I finally realized that Jay wasnt me
I took my time to jot down every line thats a quotable
Critics say I dont be killing this shit but I know I do
Because I used to practice early morning and then after school
Im working on my hooks my nigga, I aint tryna battle you
But even if I did, I guarantee Id overshadow you
Like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut
Imma close cut to Common and Gucci Mane
Now thats a comparison that you probably wouldnt understand
Because I can touch the people and still keep it ghetto
As an 87 Regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror
I wear a heart on my shoulder
Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola?
Your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over
Then went to jail when we got older
That shit is a bad odor, but still I remain focused
In due time, Ill be able to swipe my card and it wont say decline
That shits embarrassing huh
Hope no one pay you no mind
But its a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line
Can you relate to my story? Can you follow my dreams
And admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen?
My momma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studio
Even though she know her tank is empty, thats who I do it fo
My pops got a different approach, yeah he believed
But he always questioned when Imma drop my debut CD
How long this gon take nigga? You still havent ate nigga
At twenty-two I had two cars and my own place nigga
Its a sacrifice I try to tell him
Thats when he turn to BET and tell me that he jealous
Of all these niggas getting money and their shit dont sound like shit
I aint tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quit
I just wanna hear you heard
Yep, yep, thats my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor thats poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs 
Like a cattle with sheep
While yall sleep I be up, cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, Ima be heard
What up DZYNE? I aint forgot nigga
You developed me, telling me I was hot nigga
You believed in me first, thats whats for sure
At the church recording, at the garage, but it worked
But me and Dave kind of felt you lost the passion
A lot was going on in your life and you needed space
But still I should have came to you first to tell you what happened
But I was seventeen and figured its best I stay away
And I was wrong, I was young and couldnt look you in the eye for what Id done
But Im telling you we aint done
Matter of fact, hows your sons? What they up to?
Remember they used to run away while you had worked on ProTools?
People I used to be in the booth till four in the morning
With school in the morning, yawning, but I was on it
Me, you and Dave was on it
Buzzing like Charlotte Hornets when that tape dropped
Where them beats nigga? Its been five years since we had rocked
Time to be heard
Yep, yep, thats my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor thats poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs 
Like a cattle with sheep
While yall sleep I be up, cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, Ima be heard
So can you feel it?
When you hear it do it pulsate your spirit?
Do it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick?
The truth can set you free if you Do the Right Thing
Word to Spike Lee, dont he look like Sounwave?
Thats kinda random, but my humor sometimes strays
Like a dog in the night
Twenty-four hours in a day but only take five minutes
To grab a pad and a pen, then send your dog a kite
I spread love like a Hippy, but Im a Black one
With Jesus Christ passion, I swear on the bible
Tabernacle to all my rivals, I aint mad
You hate a nigga for tryna help you, thats your bad
Because I figure I can make a way with these stanzas
I probably cant heal cancer, but I can heal the city
My niggas, tell me you with me
And if you is wont you pop my CD in
Open up your trunk, then let it bump, so I can be heard
Yeah, uh huh
Yep, yep, thats my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor thats poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs 
Like a cattle with sheep
While yall sleep I be up, cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, Ima be heard

Uh, So give me fifty feet champ
Run until I got a bunion and my feet cramp

And I dont need your cosign, thats a cheap stamp
You-you niggas check this cash and Im GT crashing
105 off-ramp, hey
And little nigga got it going on, G5
Going, going, going, gone
Cloud 9 mind state
I drop a record then I raise the crime rate

Snap my fingers, shell go find a bitch
Tell them fuck boys that I do this
Got the best product round town, Frank Lucas
Confuse em like a Rubix cube when I roll up
Ok, Subway bread like some cold cuts

The shit, a booth for me is a bathroom stall
If youre not fond of me, youre comedy, Little Duval
I have a lot of flaws, Im human before all
I wake up in the morning smell some coffee, then tell your bitch to get off me
Mos Def, word to every autopsy
Man that boy bad, man that boy spaz
Til he crash like Sandra Bullock and Luda on the ave
He changed his name, he a conscious rapper
Naw muthafucka Im just Comptons rapper
I might spit some intricate shit for retards not to get
But really Im just as rude as Marshall Mathers
Is that a contradiction? He contradicting himself again?
Of course thats a contradiction, the fuck you think life is?
We not like like Christ is
We all want ices and devices to make the bitches say I like this
People dont understand why I went southpaw
I looked in the mirror and said I cant be like yall
I cant be like Game, I cant be like Eazy
To get in this rap game, I know it wont be easy
Cause my shit different
I know
He from Compton, where he from, have he killed before?
Truth is, I aint the most ruthless, but Im not cupid
Before she had two kids my momma worked two gigs
To get out Chicago
To move right back to another ghetto, on Sante Fe playing the lotto
I used to want a champagne two door Tahoe
Until I seen that same truck shot by five-o
Dead with his eyes closed, yall shouldve seen him
Off a gallon of cough syrup, but rifles had leaned him
Thats why these tough rappers man I dont believe em
Yall wanna be em, I wanna grab bats and beat em
So they can feel the pain of the blocks Im from
Where my heart turned numb
And the powder and the shells come up off that gun
Come up off your chain, or come up off your life and have a fatherless son
Its the syllabus for the ignorant militant mind
quivalent crimes for jail sentencin
No one preventin this war
You sure, you sure
Sure as the edges on every ocean, now lets explore
The Kendrick Lamar LP I been promotin for bout a month
Dont worry its comin soon, like a fast nut
I never be gassed up, some labels they passed up
Now the industry crashin, I guess they got bad luck
Your bad, you dont write neither? There goes another fad
Shit I write ether
I get it in like the Vanna on Wheel of Fortune forcin your forfeit
With the strength of the prime forces of four fork lifts
This is very extra necessary
This extra scary, this is Amityville
This the Exorcist on ecstasy pills
And if I cant do it my integrity will
Head dog wishes, every Compton bitch is
I mean this shit is
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
They all got a fat ass but lower case titties
Now I gotta mix and match, jungle fever, white and black
Double D, Brittney, Becky get your mouth intact
Reg call em Jabberjaw, she gon hop skip and jog
Just to read my twitter blog
Man these hoes pitiful
And to you bloggers that say Im weak
You know how long I took to chop this fuckin beat?
Yall dont preciate shit
All yall do is hate shit
And if I dont say shit yall still say I aint shit
And thats ridiculous
I mean that shit is
Fucking ridiculous
This is the future, this is the future
I aint really drunk, I aint really drunk

Never had enough, pass me the mask, ayy
Are you down for me? Girl, been on my last, ayy
See the sirens pulling up, pigs on my ass, ayy
Even when the money come, gone way too fast, ayy
Why my grandma couldnt live? Gone way too fast, ayy
Cousin murdered in the field, gone way too fast, ayy
Got a liver full of yac, weed in the back, ayy
Got Cîroc for the hoes, chill on the stash, ayy

Dont be worried, baby, this is what I does
Backstroke, looking for a quick flood
And you be lying when you say you want our love
Two cups in, and you already lookin for love
You a cutie and lookin purty and perfect
What you drinkin? Feel amazing
Imagine, we get to thinking
Ill explore you and tour you and keep it cordial
She prestigious, the cleanest, I could be dreaming
Fuck my ex is a no-no
Did the love thing and it cost me, she crossed me
Let me work it, you feel your virgin in circles
The groovy Capo, I keep it nasty, attractive
Hit it backwards, do it faster and faster
This a classic
I done mastered the climax, you feel the pressure
Hit it over and over, we doing extra
I can stretch you and fold up
We get to mobbing, bottle popping
Im stress-free, you gave me options
Life is best in the backseat, ayy
Sunshine give me light
Words aint soundin bright
Girl, come and spend a night, ayy
I aint really drunk, I aint really drunk 
I aint really drunk, I aint really drunk

Just a lil buzz, just a lil buzz
Just a lil buzz, just a lil buzz
Just a lil buzz, just a lil buzz
I aint really drunk, I aint really drunk
I aint really drunk, I aint really drunk
I thought there was redemption in the four ethers
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, free—
You know Im borderline more than rich, had to tame the orphanage
Navigated two bitches, textin them the coordinates
Two phones literally, house party loiterin
Deals so dummy had to let several lawyers in
One day, Ill tell you how my life was unfortunate
For now, Ill tell you how fast these Porsches get
Story of the young and reckless, bout to eat my bitch for breakfast
Pink pussy been a prеference, nеver fold under pressure
Cheap shots, let it rock, eye open, Fetty Wap
Rain like confetti drop, I bet he drop
I dont hate the trendy things, just dont like to feed the trends
Mama gave me all my sins, love me when the story ends
Flowers on my uncles tomb, thousands to my aunties too
Im used to takin backstreets, last week was nothing new
Bitches is my scapegoat, who I made this tape for?
I tell the story two years later, for now, the case closed
Ive heard so much about it
You talk about it all the time
I wanna go there, inside your mind
Melodic Blue
Reporting live, Compton California
The good kid
Im tired of doing it the same way
Gotta Flip it before I ruin it
Make it all make sense
Before you put your 2 in it
Opinions get thrown out the window
With Ron Browz so turn me up loud
So the world can hear
And when your favorite rapper
Be rapping you should cover your ears
And go deaf, go deaf I said
Go death and stay dead
A shot to the foreheadll kill em
But I aint here for no ignorance
I’m militant, as Martin Luther King
In the penitent, aiming for my dreams
Till a bullet bounce off
One of my deep thoughts
And hit a nigga in the spleen
I got it in my genes
You probably think Im talking bout a pistol
But Im talking bout the blood of a warrior
My nigga what you worry for?
I aint trying to jock your swag
Im trying to better my craft and stay relevant
Yeah, as time flies
Hope that Im soaring
Far from the boring
Ima
Tell you why
Its important
Im not the boring, 
If I think and act like you do
The world would die
From not seeing something new
And if I dont speak on how I feel
The world would lose out on
Whats really real
And if I should die before I wake
I pray my music will take my place
The World
The Relevant
Id rather you call me that
Then a typical artist you call wack
On a Youtube blog holding ARs and stacks
Of ones but never could be the one
To rally communities or
Lead a crowd of blacks
Passion is to strong
Im pissed off
So theres a chance you get pissed on
R Kelly was in the wrong
But that dont make you an exempt
That dont make you a no go from hittin the fence
You aint a blood and
Damn sure you aint a crip
The crowd yell OH!
But I aint a pimp
Im me, Im free as a 5 finger discount
See you on the flipside
Right after I dismount, if I
Ever feel like I aint pushin myself
Ill find a cliff then push myself
Off the edge like a barber
At the tip of your head
Thats how I settle it
Life or death if I aint relevant
Yeah, as time flies
Hope that Im soaring
Far from the boring
Ima
Tell you why
Its important
Im not the boring, 
If I think and act like you do
The world would die
From not seeing something new
And if I dont speak on how I feel
The world would lose out on
Whats really real
And if I should die before I wake
I pray my music will take my place
The World
The Relevant
So feel free to not mind me
If your used to boosters
Drug dealers and shooters its on wax
Cause most of yall niggas fabricate facts anyway
I could have easily cheat and let the 44 play
Like a 2 on 2 orgy
But I been there and it bores me
Got to the point where it did nothing for me
At 40 I want to afford not to record bullshit
In my story, and Im mad young so Id rather do it now
Before my careers done, this is pain plus glory
Victory is here, if I cried
You could see strength and pride in my tears
I do it for the kids, I do it for the 23
Hour lockdowns doin time in the pen
And my pen is the only thing I got for
Hip hop to change the game
Theyll remember my name as the relevant
Yeah, as time flies
Hope that Im soaring
Far from the boring
Ima
Tell you why
Its important
Im not the boring, 
If I think and act like you do
The world would die
From not seeing something new
And if I dont speak on how I feel
The world would lose out on
Whats really real
And if I should die before I wake
I pray my music will take my place
The World

Chew you up then spit you out

You never seen a killer til you seen one on side of me
That green on the side of me
Fuckin all about my fuckin money like a sodomy
Fuck them bitches properly

My pocket full of hundreds, Im always hungry
Been hungry, I think a nigga need three stomachs
Bummy, NEVER
Middle of a conversation, I cough up a feather
And get ready for the detonation
I bomb on whoever
Whatever you bout, Im bout it twice like a woman who give twins life
I steered right through your fan base every time
Tapping your demographic like I was Gregory Hines
Every line be tailor made, hella paid, count that money, several ways
Im a beast, fuck a mansion, I rather live in a cave
Sasquatch is back, but what yall really didn’t know is sasquatch can rap
Motherfucker, Im iller
Ok, I squeeze the juice out a rapper and just squash this track
The people like What the fuck happened and where Wayne be at?
Theres some boy named K Dot and hes a maniac!
I think his vocals is strapped, with a toolie, in fact
He spit like a Uzi, rat-tat-tat
He just shot me in my back, somebody pick up my back
I think that boy from Iraq, I think yall boys better know that
He got it on lock like a Low Jack
Heading straight for the top like a ball cap
Yall better fall back, yall better crawl back where yall came from
Aint one better than the one who can write like Langston Hughes from the brain off top
Like a bottle dude, get a hollow, where you swallow food
Get a model, bet she swallow, who? Me
Bet she goggle like a scuba diver eyes in the sea
Recognize who I be, K. Dot motherfucker
Dot motherfucker, hot motherfucker, drop top when ya popped with the Glock
On sight motherfucker, sight motherfucker, ride motherfucker, die motherfucker
When I go pop, pop
Open up, close shop like a retail spot
Everybody know I be where the money lie, eat where the money lie, shit where the money lie, sleep where the money lie
Bitch thats no lie, let the truth be told
K Dizzle, the Big Sizzle, turn beats to stoves, burn up
Rappers: Im iller
Dig it, like it, love it a lot

I let you duck me, then you celebrated
Whyre you showin off because you with your friends, dawg?
Dont be showin out when you with your friends, dawg
Makes no sense, dawg, dawg, dawg
These niggas tryna ride the wave, ride the wave, yeah
Makes no sense, dawg, dawg, dawg
These bitches tryna ride my face, ride my face
For all my niggas doing drugs
Fucking hoes and showing love
Pants still sagging to the floor
Sagging through your turf like I own this fucking earth
Thats on my fucking life, Im just living fucking life
This aint House Party 5 but whats popping for tonight
I got a lil more dough to spend
Lets rest in peace up on the LB like Nate did
Yall aint smoking yall joking
Nugs big as Chuckie Cheese tokens and Im toking
Bum house on Skid Row aint this potent
Holy shit, Im God-Scent, admire my stench
Cállate la boca in the presence of the most high 
Most high , Most high 
Yea you heard me right
True achiever, new Adidas still tryna earn my stripes
For all my niggas doing drugs
Fucking hoes and showing love
For all my niggas doing drugs
Fucking hoes and showing love
Its easy to assume we doing decent, true indeed
Im not from here, Im of Heaven descent
And youd agree, as sure as one and two is three
Youd have this music down to a tee if you was me
Its 36 Os in a key
Its only one in Ab-Soul, still open doors
Dont forget the dash, I might leave you with a gash
And I aint doing no more shows unless Im getting cash
Phillies full of hash, city on my back, nigga
Fucked around and put Del Amo on the map, nigga
Carson, Californication, no travel agent
But every days a vacation and mothafuckas hate it
I flew in, but I aint complaning
And everyday Im raining, got the most precipitation
Soulo, Top Dawg Administration
Top Notch, Crock Pot Hot, wear your apron
Stop, watch, grab a stop watch, apply patience
And watch us pop across the population
For all my niggas doing drugs
Fucking hoes and showing love
For all my niggas doing drugs
Fucking hoes and showing love
Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run this shit
Go and tell em Soul told em, lick a scrotum, suck a dick
Down for what Im up against, clowning when you see me styling
Joking, smiling, scoped your poker face through these black shades
 in the middle of the barn
At least I think so I cant quite remember where we are
All I see is stars nigga, All I see is stars
I dont know if Im on the red carpet or on Mars
Shout out to my bitches, givin it up on the first date
Between 21 & 38...
Great
For all my niggas doing drugs
Fucking hoes and showing love
For all my niggas doing drugs
Fucking hoes and showing love

Motherfuck the government, democrats, republicans
Can shove it up, where they take a shit, we in this bitch
In a sense, Im militant with a trigger finger itch
Cause Im always killing it, you see this shit in my cerebral I invent
It should be illegal, I admit, surrender quick
I wanna see hands and white flags no matter if you teach
Eighth grade or you move weight like a gastric bypass
Get a good look at my ass before you kiss it, sons of bitches
Get well acquainted with it, we gon be here for a minute
HiiiPower, pissing on the Declaration of Independence
And you can bet my John Hancock the biggest
Fuck a proposition, less its in my best, interest
Kissing ratchets in the mouth, lift her dress and show address
Dont be so upset, show some love when you see a thug
Getting pitta bread, I put the nina to your head
You heard what I said
Soul
If you had a second chance in life, what would you do?
Would you put the pills down? Throw out the lean too?
Treat your baby mama right and make way for your kids?
Peace with your enemies, keep the water under the bridge?
I think about if my motorcycle crash was fatal
Broken bones, internal bleedin, stretched on the table
Goin through surgery, two machines helping me breathe
Sorry mama, I wanna stay but I gotta leave
I see my funeral packed, I see some lyin
Some cryin and some givin dap
I see false claimers, strangers and foes with they head in they laps
I see mo division
I see some of them showin up just to post a picture
Like they was my nigga, Instagrams a dead mans best friend
Everybody lookin for likes but wasnt likin you when
You needed somethin to hold on dealin with life stress
Glad them angels came in surgery, said Im not done yet!
I know saints, I know sinners, I know bosses
I know pain, I know wins, I know losses
My loyalty is sensitive so please dont cross me
My loyalty is sensitive so please dont cross me
I came to redeem myself
All I need is Gods help
Its a millions of miracles
Show me the real you, the real truth
If I had a second chance in life, this what Id do
I buy you flowers talk to you for hours, give you truth
I listen to you when youre hurt
I shoulda went to church with you
But my credentials didnt work, I still shouldve worked with you
I shouldve left them lil hoes alone and came home
But I blamed the moments on you, though I was in the wrong
You checked my phone and I checked you bout it
We never talked it over, instead we just sexted bout it
I said, Im comin over, you turned up and flexed about it
I hit yo mama phone
She said, Yall get it together, she dont know what we on
My response was whatever, Im ego trippin however
I hate to see you gone, she gave me that dial tone
I shouldve gave you more trust, more love, no lies, more us
Cause when my motorcycle crashed and everyone left
You was that angel at surgery sayin I aint done yet, real shit
I know saints, I know sinners, I know bosses
I know pain, I know wins, I know losses
My loyalty is sensitive so please dont cross me
My loyalty is sensitive so please dont cross me
I came to redeem myself
All I need is Gods help
Its a millions of miracles
Show me the real you, the real truth

Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin this
Parmesan where my accountant lives; in fact, Im downin’ this
DUSSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, wont you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
Its levels to it, you and I know
Bitch, be humble 
Sit down 
Be humble
Sit down 
Be humble
Sit down 
Be humble
Sit down 
Who dat nigga thinkin that he frontin on Man-Man? 
Get the fuck off my stage, Im the Sandman 
Get the fuck off my dick, that aint right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
Im so fuckin sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mamas couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I dont fabricate it, ayy, most of yall be fakin, ayy
I stay modest bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it wont be the alcohol, ayy
Im the realest nigga after all
Bitch, be humble 
Sit down 
Be humble
Sit down 
Be humble
Sit down 
Be humble
Sit down
Im heavy hearted, heavy handed, misunderstanded
Turn a permanent repercussion, I empty the cannon
Im addicted to ganja, roll it up in the wood
Drink a gallon of Henny, throw it up for the hood
Ima ride for my people, give my people a voice
Never followed a leader, use my weapon of choice
This is not an illusion, this is not a mirage
Conversation with God, spilling my soul out
I own assault weapons that fold out like Megatron
The iron long, drop bottom bombs on Babylon
So tag along like a dog with a vagabond
Smoke till the cess is gone
Niggas on their grind, put my motherfucking records on
So they can relate to the hate and the pain
To the struggle and strain
Never take it in vain, breathing one and the same
Pressure push your forehead out the back of your brain
So west
Bout to bring the coast back, bout to bring the coast back
Told them make it nasty like some motherfucking cognac
Pull up on your niggas like Jordan at the three line
Still in the hood, hanging like beehives
Your money like knee-high, my money like ye-high
I whip the Porsche like its a horse, maybe say yee-ha
We striped like Adidas, and be bang like speakers
Bout to cop a couple of houses and have more spots than cheetas
You sell with the coke, I sell with the flow
You off-brand rappers wouldnt sell/sail with a boat
You be tweeting a lot, you be talking too much
But when daytime pass, you still wouldnt bust
We can pinky-promise, but I still wouldnt trust
They talk down on me, but I still look up
Just was talking to Nip, he say he still fucked up
Its the westside, niggas get chipped like woodchuck
What I represent, the whole coast line
All on my back, fool, Ima hold mine
I do it everyday, I do this every time
I got my motherfucking nine every, every time
I told you why I came, see this is all about
The way we push the east coast all the way to the south
You see us in the north, hey man, we going off
Seventeen shots, hit em, look, throw the Molotov
Blowing up the building, I raise, everybody feel it
Everywhere a rage, you can feel me coming through
Everyday dropping down, throw everything I got
When I fly high as the sky
Walking on the clouds, say it loud
Im so hood, nigga, too bad to be good
Looking at em like I wish they would
I burn em all every time, any place and they know they could
Step to the side any place, stepping up in Inglewood
I got the homies, on lock
They dont make em like me no more
Matter of fact, they never have, never will
Theyll never be another E 4-0
I told you once before
I aint rapping too fast, yall just listening too slow
You may not see me on the TV channel
But in the hood Im still hot like the left-sink handle
Mobster like Marlon Brando or should I say Tony Soprano?
I hit you with the heel of my .40 caliber handle
Platinum and gold plaques
I was doing the damn thing while yall was drinking Similac
Macking on mine, thats what I told your batch
She think Im a .jpeg, she wanna get attached
Turn up like the vegetable
Speaking of vegetables, right now Im on this medical
I got this heinous style Im feeling mane, Im throwed
Im a boss, put the president on hold
I got big plans to make, big dough to get
I got big tracks to rhyme on, this supposed to hit
Got big bottles to buy, big bushes to saw
Now how the hell yall hate me and Im just like yall?
I need a watch thats shiny
To make the spine be the same color as the piping on the seats behind me
Diamonds in the ring, and the watch is apparent
I aint gotta prove Im fly; parrot
I’m Phillip Drummond producing the Mrs. Garret
If the shoe fits, ten and a half, I can wear it
I spit it like I meant it, you resent it? Splendid
I spit the four bars before this verse had ended
Whatever the trend is, I pen, this is not freestyle
I’d like to see my pistol like Lennon did
A big kid, and an even bigger adult
Im slow flowed, I should be pushing Renault
And Im solo, yo
If I said Id be doing this at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be just the innocent Kendrick youve seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat
Im mashing all of my skeletons, would you jump in a seat
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And its safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer, a doctor
Instead of a boy with a chopper that hold the culdesac hostage
And do em all if they gossip
Children on the corn, stay vandalizing the option
Of living a lie, driving their bodies with toxics
Constantly drinking and drive
Hit the powder then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen coward the concept is aim it, then bang it, then slide
Out the bitch the deposit
The prize on his head that tithes probablyll go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the critics
And Snoop passed us the torch, Ima burn you rappers with it
Whats up?
Yeah, its back on me
I guess Ill take the microphone casually
And do my thug-izzle straight from the dome
And let you niggas know thats watching at home
BET, easily, let me show you how it go
S-N double O, break down a smooth flow
Breaking like dominoes
Lay it on the table for you
Let you a little game for your mind
Get a lawyer, this is too much for you
You couldnt understand
Let me drop another plan holding my left hand
Moving my right hand, dropping the next game
Quik doing his damn thing, Im spitting mo flame
Preme there on the turntables cutting up shit like
Snoopy D-O double G, making you get right
Never, ever hit like, we do this like
West coast motherfucker, bust in your face like
What?
See yall dont understand me
My plan B is to win ya hearts before I win a Grammy
Kendrick Lamar, words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
Marching on Rosecrans in Compton
You cant cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
Im on point like period
Ive been there and gone before you get near it
Ooh wee, that boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
The way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in
Family, God and honor
From Chicago, my daddy and my momma
Came to Compton to accomplish one thing
Raise a king, reign supreme, named Kendrick
I aint lying, it stand for king and I am one
My unborn son and grandson will live royal
From the coochie to the soil
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Well Ive had this world since birth
Feel the good kids hunger
The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger
Muscle in my heart
Stare at the eyes of Mozart, then tell him Im the genius
Do my dougie and grab my penis
Cause I means this with all my soul
And you cant control greatness less you hating with the heart of Satan
But even that cant stop it
Nigga, get out my wallet and put passion in your logic
Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me
And if you say it aint, you may offend me
Damn that boy good
Bright as Thomas Edison, but Gucci man hood
He stood alone for so long
Prolonged his whole career, but now hes here
You can shoot shots or cheer cause I... am

TICKETS WITH ON SALE FRIDAY 9 13
America, God bless you if its good to you
America, please take my hand
Can you help me underst—
Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin, he was mobbin, way belligerent and drunk
Talkin out his head, philosophin on what the Lord had done
He said: K-Dot, can you pray for me?
Been a messed up day for me
Know that you anointed, show me how to overcome.
He was lookin for some closure
I can bring him closer
Spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him
I cant sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody killed my son, that mean somebody gettin killed.
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
Ill wait in front a homies spot and watch him hit his block
Ill catch the homie leavin service if thats all I got
Ill chip a homie, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, Man, I did that!
Aint no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I cant even keep the peace, dont you play with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my mama
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, man, I promise
You chip the homie, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, Im bout to speak at this convention
Call you back—
{Gunshot}
The screen reads: This is a satire by Kendrick Lamar
Its not a place
This country is to me a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around
Its not a place
This country is to me a thought that offers grace
For every welcome that is sought
Run your life, I live a better life, Im rollin several dice
Run your life, I live a better life, Im rollin several dice
Run your life, I live a--
Run your life 
This is my heritage, all Im inheritin
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
--
Tell me somethin
Uh, you cant tell me nothin
Id rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin bullets, reapin what you sow
And stackin up the footage, livin on the go
And sleepin in a villa
Sippin from a Grammy, walkin in the buildin
Diamond in the ceilin, marble on the floor
Beach inside the window, peekin out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows Ive been goin hammer
Dodgin paparazzi, freakin through the camera
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin to Nirvana
Watchin all the snakes, curvin all the fakes
Phone never on, I dont conversate
I dont compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder — these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Wont you tell em I got millions on the way
{Gunshot}
Hi, Im Dave Chappelle. And I just wanted to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America. Sorry for the interruption, please continue...
Sir Duckworth or Kung-Fu Kenny?
Got juice, got work, got weight, got plenty
Him, got her, got more, got Benji, yeah
Top off, gettin topped off in the city
Big Top Dawg and I dance on em like Diddy
Pop off and I pop back like Fifty, yeah
I gotta dance
I Milly Rock when I get that advance
How can I shop with like 64 Ms?
Talkin to Top about business again
He want some lot with new Bentleys again
I want some top from like two sets of twins
Twenty twin twins, yeah, yeah
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like, we like
Fast cars, fast money, fast life, fast broads
Egotistic, goin ballistic, why God?
Born warrior, lookin for euphoria, but I dont see it
I dont feel it, Im paraplegic, tapped in when Im maxed in
Comp-Town with the MAC 10s and the pumps in the background
Absent, never OG, standout
Lackin everything else but doubt
Magnum, holding Magnums with a Magnum
Homie, ad-lib and I sing out loud
Never had friends, never had ends, never had hope
They was like, Nope, I was like, Boo yaow, boo yaow
{Gunshot}
Is this on cable? CBS? It looks like its singing and dancing, but this brothers taking enormous chances. Rumble, young man, rumble!
Never had friends, never had ends
Never had hope, they was like nope
I was like boo yaow
{Gunshot}
We off the day
Know we off the, be off the, eat off your plate
Me off, I be, Off ya head
Ate, on C4, Im way off the edge
Burn integrity, burn your pedigree, burn your feelings
Burn your culture, burn your moral, burn your family
Burn your job, burn your land, burn your children, burn your wives
Who am I? Not your father, not your brother
Not your reason, not your future
Not your comfort, not your reverence, not your glory
Not your heaven, not your angel, not your spirit
Not your message, not your freedom
Not your people, not your neighbor
Not your baby, not your equal
Not the title yall want me under
All hail King Killmonger
For the record, I used to do a lot of humping when I was little
I got a lot of whoopings over that shit too, and thats random, but so what? Ha-ha-ha
Gimme that beat fool, this a full time jack
No really this a Sounwave track
So really I aint gotta steal nothing all I gotta do is kill it
When you press record button let the paralyzed feel it
I came back with a full time swag
And the critics thought they had me
Nah, I just bought more batteries
Turned up supercharged, a medium away from living large
Matter fact where my niggas at?
Where my bitches with them pretty weaves?
Enemies bleed on the maxi pad, pussy you fucked with the wrong one
Im on one, Ill make sure your kids breathe pneumonia
Good kid, mad city evil in my heart
From the blood niggas fucking with me, crip niggas tryna kill me
Malcolm X mind state, if I raise the crime rate
Its a legitimate reason why
I put on repeat Kanyes Touch the Sky
But Ill be looking past that Im tryna touch God
My heart to the heavens, the rebel of the reverend
Yall married to the game well Im bout to crash weddings
I put a lot of pain in the shit I write
If you going through something, this the shit you recite
This is bigger than life, this is Kendrick Lamar
This is Jimi Hendrix guitar on tour, bonjour, I mean war like that!
Yeah, straight like that
People dont be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! 
Youll never know when Im gone 
In 2010, Im tryna ball, nigga!
Like shooting jumpshots in the mall, nigga!
Thats a quote from Ab-Soul
I suppose since you laugh thats the ultimate goal
On behalf of the Top Dawg conglomerate, shall stay anonymous
Searching seven continents accomplishing big shit
Big ass, big tits she on me
And just to get to me shell fuck the homies... homies homies
The life of a cool nigga, my nigga Tony said
Just do you, nigga! Show and prove, nigga
And they gon play you for a fool thats for sure
til they know you got the stinkiest stool, nigga!
I aint tripping Im just tipping on fo-fos
Back in the city and tipping on four hoes
That boy got a cold cold, hes sick con, slick on
Dropin red jewels like a school bar mitzvah, ooh
Straight like that
People dont be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! 
Youll never know when Im gone 
Why yall complain about OGs?
I dont look at a legend and say you owe me
Not Snoop, not Dre, not Ice Cube
I dont care me and Quik went to the same school
I look in the mirror and do it myself
Like a self made nigga, I dont need a maid, nigga
Do I need a co-sign from Dre or Jigga?
They can make me much bigger
But do I need em though?, I just need a flow
The type of shit that make you think you seen Pac ghost
Me Against The World on you mothafuckas
I got my back against the wall and a .45, dog get smoked, Chris Tucker
Uhh, tryna record my steelo
Even when Im not there just like TiVo
The hoes tell me that I got a real big ego
And weed move slow right now but E go
You know what Im talking bout? I look at your Audemars
To put yall in time out, its time to unveil the real
And your career is about as frail as Ms. Winehouse
Just salute, grab a flute, and pull the wine out, ooh
Just like that
People dont be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! 
Youll never know when Im gone
Heard a conversation with my father talking to his favorite partner
At the domino table, Tony had told him that he saw a
Young nigga hopping out busting like four charters
Popping pills, mix a gallon of sherm and some holy water
Mix a gallon of sherm and some holy water
Sell it to a priest he probably can get it off by tomorrow
Its wicked when my favorite uncle kick it
Fiends trying to kick the addiction of sucking glass dicks
Vivid images go against any fantasy you can fathom
Phantoms aint the only thing that suicidal
Open the doorway to his soul
Hit the hallway then hit the closet you see a rifle
Aim it at your arteries, pardon me, parts of me is pyscho
In retrospect my respect was a power ranger high note
Tumbling backwards into a karate kicking high note
My innocence would eventually see a hindrance
Surrenduring Ninja Turtles, pizza and Sega Genesis
Heard it over my bunk bed ear hustling
Something my papa said that caught my attention
His eyes red hes smoking on marijuana mixing the two eleven
He said Im seven going on sixty-seven
The day I turned seventeen is the day that a lesson inside my lifetime
Come across a clothes line, every stick is a co-sign
Everything in the streets got the power to make me go blind
Even if he sat me down in the sun and gave me those eyes
Comprehend it well and I could smell the soberness evaporating by itself
He said, Tony my biggest fear is to hear Kendrick disappeared in the fire out here and I didnt help
So if I can give him the game to hydroplane his decisions in life so he can go
Further than the streets and remain to be on the honor roll
Sacrifice my life even if that shit, my mama though
Til the day he carried by the big six, domino
Backpack raps with gats in it
Dont get your cap peeled by the black menace
K Dot Thoroughbred
Move like a militant soldier
On point like a pyramid, force to be reckoned with
With the best shit
Like the strongest manure, Im ready when you are
This is it
Im in the lab cooking up all day, eff em up all day
Like a nympho, I been dope since s curl waves
Trying to convince hoes I got good hair
Knowing damn well theres chemicals there
Im in the hood with the 17 year olds thats on hood patrol
And they want stripes so they shoot off bikes and you know
Any moment you can lose your life so kiss your kids or hug your wife or whatnot yo
I spawned with a dragon
He tried to throw his flame but I ducked and I stabbed him
Came out the battle laughing
Thats a metaphor for any rapper who want it
I smack em til their nose is running
You know the hoes is coming if Im there
And the hoes is cumming once we hit that hotel
Thats no assumption, cool out before I move out
Hop on the 105 and do about 105 before your ass get threw out
The back seat
Theres a dead guy on the freeway, oh its not Dot
Tell the medics its okay, a beast when the beat break
You probably think Im dope like the its the realest shit I wrote
But to me its a throw away
I stare at them four walls and rap like Im mad at God
Nice enough, I throw a spear at Nas, a jab at Jay
Matter fact, no, I take that back
See I dont play with real legends of rap like you do
And Im crucial, concealed by real Crips and Soowoos
And they shoot, they photography students when beef get to brewing Compton!
You dont know what pain is, you just fuck with famous
I dont know you, I can tell your energy is dangerous
You dont know how long it took to finally come alive
So bitch dont kill my vibe
Yeah, I can feel the changes, and I can tell you hating
Save your breath Im sick to death of fake congratulations
You dont know how much I had to give to come alive
So what, So what?, So bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe, bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe, bitch dont kill my vibe
Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You dont know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me thats amazin
To you thats a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner whos probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me things I dont understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch dont kill my vibe, bitch dont kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today Im yelling
Bitch dont kill my vibe, bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe, bitch dont kill my vibe
Im trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
Youre trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And Im looking right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, Ill let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
Im a break out and then hide every lock
Im a break out and then hide every lock
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me thats amazin
To you thats a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner whos probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me things I dont understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch dont kill my vibe, bitch dont kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today Im yelling
Bitch dont kill my vibe, bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe, bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch, dont kill my vibe!
You aint heard the Coast like this in a long time
Dont you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
Ill take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch, dont kill my vibe! Bitch, dont kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream its alive
My New Years resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, dont kill my vibe! Bitch, dont kill my vibe!
Bitch, dont kill my vibe! Bitch, dont kill my vibe!
Yeah, Kendrick Lamar

Centennial High, had me swimming with a pool of sharks
Me, Im just a good kid, tryna keep it neutral
But Im well aware that a square can get shot too
Most Crip and some Piru, thats just how the game go
Hood on every corner, stop for gas and get your brains blown
Bitches with fat asses, burning in the stashes
Murders in July, call that summer time madness
Rest in peace 4 Bent, rest in peace Mausberg
Swear to God, when I make it big, your voicell be heard
Me, Im just a good kid, tryna keep it positive
Though I know its chaos, forever my heart will live in

Earl had got disciplined for not catching a fade that week
Shit had made him stronger though, yeah those were the good old days
Eating Tams burger while my Juvenile CD had played
21 outside maybe sideline pop
Yellow tape on sidewalk damn somebody got popped
Hoping that I live a lot, I dont want to die young
Please dont come shoot up my party, I just want to have fun
Sheriffs in my rear view, mother fuck the police
Pull me over just to plant an 8 ball on me
Fuck it though Im out here, Ive always been out here
Since the Compton swap meet, black and red LA gears

I light to asses, dont ask for your favorite rapper
 Yessir Chuuch
 I killed him Bitch
And this is rigamortis and its gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and Im Morpheus, the Matrix of my mind
Im out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
Im on the toilet when I rhyme if you the shit then I decline
I climax where you begin and then I end on Cloud 9
And thats important when you morph into a angel in the sky
And dont be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply and tell me
That you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And Imma be here for a while just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you could fight, we always making them duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI, just might investigate this fucking parasite
 Thats what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony
Ferragami so many and cool enough for the 70s
Nigga, paybacks a bitch and bitch you been living in debt with me
That I more than especially, leave a call on his mother voicemail
To say that he rest in peace, bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling, thats irrelevant rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody couldnt think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q, its just me Jay Rock, Soul and Q
Solar system and barbeque, aint nothing else you can do

I rapped him and made him Casper, I captured the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya, I pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, wont you send us to bible study faster
Your hypocrite-esque reaction a blasphemy
I assassin my casualty and its casually done and tell em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds dont talk to be bout no money
The sun is under my feet and I come in peace to compete
I dont run if you rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see any assistance, everybody done see
Some persistence, recognize I be really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition, breaking up the streets, better partition, better dot your T
And I gon mention, how the far you see, putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitchin, getting mad at me, recognize Kendrick in the battery
And Im charged up and the catastrophe is charged up and the audacity
And yall fucks, never could hassle me and yall luck, just ran out youll see
 Yup-yup I know

Retaliation talk Exactly
Nasty the classy the flashiest how Im on it
Dont ask me no kind of questions and mention
Ill leave your face in a pantry
And gladly lump up your shit and bumpin your face up like acne
Break your teeth, replace them with veneers bigger than Little Scrappy
Feeling like growing my dread again
Letting my shit get nappy
Throw me on a New York fitted
While reppin like Im a Yankee
If they wanna front then I hit em and I tap em
Eat a niggas food like its a scampi
When it come to bitch niggas, Im a little bit a racist
Governor Pataki
Papi, here to massacre aunti
Now pops was a little bit manly, fuck all that aiming
Imma hit him in the front, hit him in the back
So substanc-y
Then I gotta Bit-a-bit-a-bit-a-bit-a-beat a nigga leave him in the alley
You dont really really know how you niggas always be making me aggie
Organs in your drawers now you wearing your pants saggy
Haggling niggas with scriptures Im spittin, you should be happy
Gradually when I hit you I split you and leave you sadly
In a situation lay you out flatter than chicken patties
Its the God, you hear me talking whenever you hear the raspy
And when it comes to murkin something you should never put it past me!
 :
Got me breathing with dragons
Ill crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
Im Marilyn Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic
I light to asses, dont ask for your favorite rapper
 Yessir Chuuch

That’s whatever the mind can deceive and believe
The mind can achieve
Regardless of how many times you may have failed in the past
Or off day your aims and hopes may be
Go getter, with no cheddar
Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
My life is likely to see great endeavors
But I cant win if I cant get it together
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the worlds best to call me the best?
Pull up at the Grammy awards as the best dressed
With an address linked to a beautiful actress?
A dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole
Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
That dont wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition

Show and prove, prove youre the one
Its not about who is dopest
Who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the worlds best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy awards as best dressed
With an address next to a beautiful actress
Do I gotta run in your spot and start blastin
Better yet, rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing
Ear hustle on a nigga thats constantly braggin
Catch him at the light, snatch him out his Jeep wagon
Or maybe I gotta hook up with Jose
Cop 5 bricks of the yay, head to the Bay
Area or carry the birds to VA
Let the Clipse distribute the work all day
Then come back home
Every three weeks flip three to six zones
Homies on the block can say whatever they want
I dont wanna be a dealer, I wanna be a Trump
Donald, that is
In time, itll come
Just stay focused and humble, my son
Show and prove, prove youre the one

She paused the iPhone then said, Huh?
I repeated what I said then she replied, Shut up.
You know you the best boy, you gotta keep doing it
But dont forget when you do, just keep you in it
And never listen to what the industry say

Russell, Barry Gordy, Quincy Jones, Bob Johnson, Sean Combs, L.A. Reid
Young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah
So I gotta see success, I gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps

I was born on February 24th, 1970
The day I was delivered they said I would build a legacy
Picture me with influence that last generations
I was made out of love to keep you happy and educated
The first three letters of the alphabet my name
I made you laugh, I made you dance, I made you sing
I been around the world and back, you recorded my almanac
So dearly way before the fact me and pops was estranged
My father was a public figure, bigger than life
Lived as a winner, on stages alike
Rivers of people surely united, just to see our bond
Time carried on, that was a common thread
My perfect father had many flaws
Still they moved they legs and shook they heads in unison
He had more children, I was the oldest
We always played with each other fore they ruined em
He told me his personal secrets, childhood catching on beatings
Sexually touched and abused, never seen life in a school
The price of being iconic was demonic and screwed
I stood on stage and had to watch my father on the news
Stress on the head of my spirit, I was lost and confused
I knew both sides of the story, but still, I couldnt choose
See, it was more than humiliation and bein sued
They crucified my affiliation for points to prove
And now my purpose for livin makes no difference to you
My total existence was for makin a smiling move
They said that Ill live forever
But the moment he died, more accusations arrived
I had to die too
I remember takin my first breath August 28th, 1963
The whole nation had saved the day, I made it on TV
My come out was a standing ova, the crowd in disbelief
How could a group of words be so great?
Designed to make you think
Races and faces embracin my conscience in letter form
How gracious was I speakin on changes once outside the norm?
The person responsible, my creator
He never conformed or used hatred to form mass retaliation
Watch him perform with conviction
Two hundred and fifty thousand souls left they homes to listen
I gather his thoughts in abundance made to complete the mission
His life became heroic, then tables turned
My creator stripped from being a poet because he yearned
Other women, infidelity stricken, I cant say he was perfect
It made me nervous, they tear him down and forget me
I prayed that I survived in the midst of the controversy
How many livesll fall on deaf ears if Im not worthy?
I wont justify his personal problems, thats not my job
I was only born to make sure your children can play outside
And I imagine the other demons he hid before he died
If they came to surface this dream probably wont be alive
Because of you
I was born in paranoia, its poison for us
We cant create with joyous ambition, were out of luck
The critics formed a new coalition and huddled up
The non-creators are now elated and out of touch
Why cant you gladly appreciate the influence we give?
Stop starin at me disgusted, my substance made sure youd lived
You want the head of the messenger and the history from him
Which eventually takes away from the good you accustom
Think of a life without the likes of imagination thats prosperin
The bodies that you consider genius, you like to box em in
The great debaters and thinkers, they gave you a voice
Why cant you prosecute the crimes and not the thoughts I employ?
Because your better judgement will always look down on me
But if I recollect how we connect, youll account on me
I got a theory that most of yall wont allow to see
It goes like this, talent doesnt choose morality
See, if Daniel Hale was a killer, would you not want a heart?
If Carl Benz was a racist, would you stop driving cars?
I cant help we jump in these bodies and you called them a god
Just know the Earth is just a rock without the voices of art
Sincerely yours
Lifestyles of the kid who never had shit
Living off that bad shit, that shoot shit, that stab shit
Rock a flag and don’t give a fuck about U.S flag shit
George Bush got some nerve, fuck a war, we trying to serve
Motherfucking 8 balls, til’ we live at the pool hall
And knock billiards out of your business, ya bitch
Thats my surroundings in Compton, have common sense
Smell death in the air, around here, thats a common scent
You know the gunpowder
You know when your homie barely blink, he just done powder
Only at seventeen
You know the common statistic inspired by hoop dreams
Now hire about street schemes, and getting blood money
I try my best to stay focused and hope the city love me
Pray its not lust, cause if it is, I’d be death in a month
Lord forbid, for the good kid
They took his life
She want her baby back, like a cooked rib
But that’s just life, where I’m from
If there’s a shining star
Hope my city is not too far
So we can live again
See, where I come from is hard
Hope all over, we can start
So we can live again, so we can live again
I’ve seen this young’un on the train, I had to pick his brain
He said he on his way uptown to get a brick of caine’
He said he needed a come up, because selling nicks was lame
He needed a change, so I gave him fifty cent
He looked up at me like I was crazy, I said listen man
I rather give you my last to see you live again
Just cause you change what you pitching, don’t make the difference
You gotta get off the mound, and put the game down
Petty thoughts could keep your brain down
I leave you with that jewel, go get the chain now
And put it together
You see coming up, we ain’t have that shit to keep our mind focused
I love Mike, but it was a hassle trying to buy Jordans
My nigga hustle all day in front of the corner store
To get a pair, niggas killed him right in front the mall
So all the hustling for nothing man
I threw my pair on the lightpole because of him
Like fuck it man
Trying to move foward, though it never stops
A mother’s son dead, was killed by some kids popped
Shots, they back and forth
Murder for murder, the beef recycled is light
No idols, bunch of unread bibles
Allies that turned to rivals, niggas turned street disciples
Smokers get high as Eiffiels
Addicted to being fiends
Because of the feds as we pledge to let our plague spread
Tiny this and if and that if they banging back
Because they
Adapt to being black, strapped and gang tats, look
Rats get mouse trapped
Can’t afford tuition
But hit a lick I bet I earn crack, I heard that
Looking at the sky, hoping a light would shine
Daylight saving times all the time on this block of mines
All the time with this Glock of mines
Swear to God man it ain’t a rhyme, I grind for a piece of mine
Co-sign
When you look at my brothers, whats your first impression?
Does the sight of us leave you guessing?
Or do you understand the stressing, the aggression
The look of no hope on my niggas faces
Like the Lord overlooked us when He handed down His graces
See embraces, fall short on the numb tips of street entrepeneur fingers
Stuck in the walls of the project halls where the Coke smell still lingers -
External blingers is all we can be
Cause on the inside we been given nothin to shine on
And the gig is harder to get than Coke so niggas get their grind on
Because the TV tells us aim high Nigga, make all goals lateral
But that takes paper that we dont have so niggas put their souls up as collateral
Now, some niggas reclaim em, some blame em
Making excuses to sell em
But when a nigga goes from not doin, to doin
What can you tell him?
Not to be a nigga?
Shit I gots to be a nigga thats how I pay the bills and Imma do that whether I gotta sling this coke or exploit these rhyme skills
Bumping some Sade rolling my window down and hitting the highway
No its not Friday, but its my day and sometimes shit gotta go my way
Niggas got me fucked up thinking that my music dont stick like some nunchucks
Top Dawg and we All Stars like we run Chucks, but nevermind that
Take a trip to outer space show you where my mind at
You know where my grind at
Inside of the studio is where I spend my time at
Fuck over the game till I make that bitch climax
Miss me with that bullshit, haters die young you can run to the pulpit
Pullin off the pit stop, card like a flip flop
Bitches clap at me like they wanna make my piss hot
I dont even trip though I dont need no company
Me, Im thinking long-term tryin build a company
Kendrick the Good Kid
As I move, I feel way better doing me
I can only do me
I hope that, you do you
I think to myself truthfully, I can only feel me
Some people say that Im rude
But I dont give a damn
If she, if he, if them or they say Im uncool
Nothing will change now I feel me today
Nigga what I compose be so potent
That if the Earth dried I could spit back the ocean
Then hop on the jet ski and start Westcoastin
Im not boasting or bragging
Not a person, Im a dragon
Taking action in the heat of the night
So if the devil came, tell him that Ill be alright
Im so high off life that I can OD
Walk outside then sniff a whole key
Oh lady dont call the police
Its just the Average Joe walking with his heart on his appendix
Dont be afraid to speak
So to speak, you niggas not within arm-reach
Yall midget macks swingin on Shaq now have a seat
You can never co-exist with my mommas oldest
Kendrick be thy name I got my mind right
My nigga locked in the pen thats why my mind write
Ink over my brain, Whas up?!
As I move, I feel way better doing me
I can only do me
I hope that, you do you
I think to myself truthfully, I can only feel me
Some people say that Im rude
But I dont give a damn
If she, if he, if them or they say Im uncool
Nothing will change now I feel me today
So let me start off the third verse
Pickin off your favorites since Im cursed
Fuck the system, fuck the truth, fuck religion
Fuck the government, fuck the law, fuck the prisons
Fuck George Bush, fuck rappers who love dissing
Fuck you because you dont see my vision
I fucked your new girlfriend too because shes cute
And the ass look like a grenade within the denim
Fuck the groupies, fuck the gossipin bitches
Fuck niggas who cant fight so pull triggers
Fuck the new world gas price that costs a living
Fuck your love, fuck your hate, fuck your snitching
And whether you fuck with me or not
I dont give a fuck you could keep your props
Fuck keeping it real, Imma keep it K-Dot
Kendrick everyday, JAY-Z didnt lie
Fucka!
As I move, I feel way better doing me
I can only do me
I hope that, you do you
I think to myself truthfully, I can only feel me
Some people say that Im rude
But I dont give a damn
If she, if he, if them or they say Im uncool
Nothing will change now I feel me today
Cause I aint about to roll it if I aint rollin that fire
Yeah the sun is goin down but Im tryna take you higher
We both know this house could never be a home
But aint you sick of spendin all your nights alone?
If its lovin that you want, girl, I promise you desire
No conversation when I come around
Run my fingers through your baby hair
I wanna take you there
For sure, you know what its about
Well find our limit when you say were there
I wanna take you there
You toot it up, I tear it down
You bring it back, I wear it out
Hit it like whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop
Baby, youre the finest
Pussy taste like diamonds
Howd you get so timeless?
Wanna get behind it, behind it
Remind ya, I know how to find it
Hit it how you like it
Show you how we slide, how we slide, back in L.A., L.A.
Park circle, that way
Ready for the showdown, the Wild Wild West way
Ooh, you know youre flame
And I put that on my last name
Ima take my time in it, climb in it for the day
No conversation when I come around
Run my fingers through your baby hair
I wanna take you there
For sure, you know what its about
Well find our limit when you say were there
I wanna take you there
You toot it up, I tear it down
You bring it back, I wear it out
Hit it like whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop
Cause I aint about to roll it if I aint rollin that fire
Yeah the sun is goin down but Im tryna take you higher
We both know this house could never be a home
But aint you sick of spendin all your nights alone?
If its lovin that you want, girl, I promise you desire
In due time Im the modern day Albert Einstein
Im prime time like Deion
And the rest of yall is peons
I pee on the best
Whoever you are you can step
Like a prosthetic leg
I see monsters in my head
Thats why I rap with such aggression
I tear down studio sessions
Rappers scared, they walk in the booth
With a bible and a reverend
I use my mouth as a weapon
Bullets rip through your mid section
Rat tat a tat tat tat rata tat tat tat
Im a Comptown, nigga get a casket
Go against me, thatll lead to my advantage
Because Ive got to eat
And for real Im feeling kind of famished
Hotter than the earth core, dont show me where no fan is
Show me where your fans is so they can see the real
Im sick and electrifying, thats double ill
Me feel like me will be a legend like Will was a legend
But Im not an actor, put that in my will
Gimme a second uncut coke lyrics what Im stressing
She want the raw so I fed her lines like Kevin
Tell em Im a werewolf, behold the 5 6 bigfoot
Lear jet overlook the country like Garth Brooks
Lyrics on point, plus I got the right hooks
Like Tommy Hearns, punchlines burn
Im not concerned about the SoundScan
Cause most of yall is drowning
A lifeguard thats lounging
Meaning I dont worry about none of you rappers
Im way more live
Thats evil backwards
Now with that great word play
I tend to let my words play
Like children on a Saturday
Its sad to say youre not up to par
And I dont play with mini golf and sharks
Jump inside the pool of sharks, were biting off your head, your heart, your legs, arms
Bled like Jay Rock or Big Wy
And make sure you wear a vest
Because they my family ties
Suit up
You got a three piece? I got a three piece
A MAC-11, a 9 mili, and a DE
He backpedaling like a DB
Im such a Martian
Call me ET
Always behind it like I own the TP
I shit, fart, pee pee
On anybody track
Walk in the booth and drink down a fifth of Ex-Lax
Wassup
Now phone home
My nigga Punchline is on, wipe em down
Your boy carry that flame I am a arsonist
I spit arsenic at you niggas cartilage
Ill wip, drive by, niggas carsick
20 on the charm
VVS studded flawless
Try and reach we specialize in garbage
Taking out the trash put you underneath the tar pits
How many times I gotta tell yall niggas the big fish in the small pond
I wail on niggas Im vicious
No, Im serious
Skip the birth canal and climb straight Cesarean
You niggas aint listening
Im not from round these parts
Im nonexistent
Hit you with brake light
Leave you missing
Blessed are the bullies
For one day they will have to stand up to themselves
Blessed are the liars
For the truth can be awkward
Its not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around
Look around, look around
Look around, its a sound
Look around, look around
Its a sound
Its not a place
This country is to me a thought
That offers grace
For every welcome that is sought
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
We came here looking for American soul
Its not a place
This is a dream the whole world owns
The pilgrims face
It had your heart to call her home
Hold on Brother John
Too many mothers weepin
Dream on Brother John
But in your dreams you cant be sleepin
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
We came here looking for American soul
American
American
Put your hands in the air
Hold up the sky
Could be too late, but we still gotta try
Theres a moment in our life where a soul can die
And the person in a country when you believe the lie
The lie 
Theres a promise in the heart of every good dream
Its a call to action, not to fantasy
The end of a dream, the start of whats real
Let it be unity
Let it be community
For refugees like you and me
A country to receive us
Will you be our sanctuary
Refu-Jesus
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul
American soul
American soul

Only concerned with my balls like Venus

And all these chickens want that rooster, call it Big Cock
Co-co-co-cock that, aim and shoot that sure shot

Big chrome .380 if a nigga try and play me
Niggas swag wavy, chauffeur got me car-pooling
So when it come to stunting, bitch I do it
Never been like you or wanted to be, I do me
She found out that Im in a group, now shes a groupie
Dont need a watch thats full of diamonds to know that its perfect timing

Yeah, keep it simple stupid, all I see is trendy all around me
T.D.E. the movement, we Sore Losers out of Dallas County

Im close as next to kingdom come, I just run my city dude
You just make your city run, they hate to be next to you
Tables turn, say you earn rights to be the God MC
Im bout to make that halo burn, now goddamn thats some irony
I am the messiah of society
Beside a Halle Berry, feed me berries in Paris, oui-oui
I carry on a great endeavor, ambition leave all men grief

BSM - we cannibals
Eat your flesh, no antidote
Kendrick - thats family though
We on Rosecrans, its a party ho
This right heres that Martin-Malcolm
Only difference we still alive
By any means necessary, squad life we down to ride
Interstate, rival Pis
Seen them tears on my mamas eyes
Do whatever it takes to keep my daughter fly
Ill do whatever it takes to be immortalized
Two presidents and we blowing presidential
Two presidents and we blowing presidential
See my hood shine, pray I live to see the day
Rest in peace to my homie, he got hit up with that 
Kendrick Martin, Hootie Malcolm
Im screaming out peace
But his chopper piece a bad outcome
Kendrick Martin, Hootie Malcolm
Im screaming out peace
But his chopper piece a bad outcome
Don’t wrap it up in gold
Don’t hide it behind the sun
Just give it to me as it is
And let it stand
Don’t fly it like a kite
Between the clouds
It needs no excuse
Just bring it down
Let eyes that are in pain look upon it
In all its glory
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
For every voice that is lifted
In reverence and pain
Show us now
And let love not be chained
We should feel what we can stand
And let us be alive
So we know
That we’ve done all we can
Let hearts that are frozen get to see it
In all its glory
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
And let all that is lost be forgotten
And it will pass
So let all that is lost be forgotten
Let us move on
Like the waters in the open sea
When tribulations come all we can say is hopefully
And yesterday you could probably say theres no hope for me
But today Im overly dedicated, Im posed to be
A testimony for broken hearts in the city
You either crash landing or planning on flying with me
Misery loves standing behind its company, well
Vividly I can see that your feelings would like to dwell
On our past encounters, reaching over the counter
Told me that its a appealing to pop a pill, thats a downer
I heard emotions burn deep
I heard when you fall out of love the drop is steep
I heard when you see a thug, thats what you try be
Got these burdens under my wings, but Im still free
Cause I can make the decision to let it all go away
Before I ever run astray Ill look you in the eye and say
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Alright yall
I want yall to put your hands together
And to bring on the brothers that bound to lay more dips in your hips
More glide in your stride
Chi city in the building
And Mr. Southside
And if you dont think its next you got the wrong damn address
Fuck your love, motherfuck your love
Thats what Sir John say
You can laugh all you want but hes right as hell
Cupids aint around these days
Ive heard many stories about how he made people all around the world fall in love
Well I got a call just the other day
Telling me where Cupid was
Cupids too busy in the club
At the bar
Rolling up
And if you see him, let him know
Love is gone
I know, Im sure
Boys and girls
Love aint dead
Stupid Im the the new Cupid
Throw your hands in the sky
Cause loves still alive
I said, Love aint dead
Stupid Im the the new Cupid
Throw your hands in the sky
Cause loves still alive
The responsibility lies on me
Since Cupid aint around
And when yall really feeling like youre falling in love
When my music puts you right on down
And everybody 
And I know 
Some people really think they in love
But now without a love song
Somethings gone way wrong
Cupids too busy in the club
At the bar
Rolling up
And if you see him, let him know
Love is gone
I know Im sure
Boys and girls
Love aint dead
Stupid Im the the new Cupid
Throw your hands in the sky
Cause loves still alive
I said, Love aint dead
Stupid Im the the new Cupid
Throw your hands in the sky
Cause loves still alive
Love aint dead
As I play out the Commodores, my faith destroyed
My heart dont work, Im unemployed
The feeling is void, dont know what I need
Some pussy, some paper, some counseling
Maybe some Henny, some weed
Im looking for you, Im checking for her
Im parking lot pimpin, Im honking at women, Im all on the curb
Skrt, skrt, skrt, pump my brake, pump my brake
Mini skirt, skirt, skirt, dont walk away, walk away
Im fishing for compliments
This is a fairy tale, I know you very well
Fuck all your promises, I know what time it is
Im just a realist, I am the realest
Reality is fatality cursed on the future for family, wife and some kids
Im looking for you, Im checking for her
Im parking lot pimpin, Im honking at women, Im all on the curb
Skrt, skrt, skrt, pump your brake, pump your brake
Mini skirt, skirt, skirt, dont walk away, walk away 
Cupids too busy in the club
At the bar
Rolling up
And if you see him, let him know
Love is gone
I know Im sure
Boys in the club
And if you see him, let him know
Love is gone
I know Im sure
Boys and girls
Might sound weird
But a great night, you in a real relationship, you understand what Im saying
A great night with somebody you love, is difficult
Somebody you like is always good
Like is wonderful
You come home with some juice, with the woman you like:
Can I have some juice?
Gimme that juice, pour juice all over me
Pour that juice all over that sexy body
Let you be together three years and shit
Can I have some juice?
Bitch, why you want my juice?
You know Im dehydrated
I try to come home and shit
Tryin to get some juice you want my juice...
Whoo Ha!
Backpack raps with gats in it
Dont get your cap peeled by the black menace
K-Dot thoroughbred
Move like a militant soldier, on point like a pyramid
A forced to be reckoned with, fuck with the best shit
Like the strongest manure, Im ready when you are
This is it, Im in the lab cooking up all day
Fuck em up all day like a nympho
I been dope since S curl waves
Trying to convince hoes I got good hair
Knowing damn well theres chemicals there
Im in the hood with the 17 year-olds thats on hood patrol
And they want stripes, so they shoot off bikes
And you know any moment you can lose your life
So kiss your kids and hug your wife, and what not yo
I spar with a dragon, he tried to throw a flame
But I ducked, then I stabbed him and came out the battle laughin
Thats a metaphor for any rapper who wants it
I smack em til their nose is running
You know the hoes is coming if Im there
And the hoes is cumming once we hit the hotel
Theres no assumptions
Cool out before I move out, hop on the 105
Do about 105 before your ass gets threw out the back seat
Oh, Its not Dot? Tell the medics its okay
A beast when the beat break
You probably think Im dope like this the realest shit I wrote
But to me, its a throw-away
I stare at the four walls and rap like Im mad at God
Nice enough to throw a spear at Nas
Launch at Jay, matter fact, let me take that back
See I dont fuck with real legends in rap like you do
Im crucial, concealed by real crips and suwoo
And they shoot like photography students when beef gets to brewing
Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel
You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me
Every MC, Im sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them
Come again, no introduction, you know my name
Soul brother, Dueces suck the juice from my ding-a-ling
Orangutan arms banging niggas like a set
When I speak, they fucking silent like sex for the deaf
Violence, I play it like violins in the orchestra
Treat you like vitamins then spit you back out
Like a verse I had way back before I had it mapped out
Rip a page out the Almanac then cross reference when I wreck shit
I wish jaw bone fractures on all of you rappers bumping your gums
Like the measles when the record meets the needle
Heads spinning like a twelve-inch, Smoking the best Celtic
Like I shot Larry Bird, follow my word
Big Herb, Ill with it, I need a hospital gown
You need 54 cards, deal with it
You may think Im killing it, but Im healing it
Like a bitch in the club, Shoe game
Ay yo yo, the flow potent
Whos more focused? Kick doors open
Deliver the golden opus leave with two guns smoking
Its me, the podium closing, a poet well-spoken
The gropes is most consistent with imminent penmanship
Mind-bending, co-existing with the written
Verbal assassin, Internally smashing, Spazzing on tracks
Translation, Im disgusting in action
A lyrical glutton busting over Sounwave productions
Yall dont want nothing, The sum of all fears
Mercury rising, Im summer all year
I sixteen em to death and wish them the best
I guess thats the gift and a curse, You see my pattering
Yall still rapping like thats whats happening
I write rhymes with fire on stone tablets
Peep the malice, Im a monster
Ya Boy running like William Joseph Crawford touche
Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel
You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me
Every MC, Im sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them
Straight up, Dont get ate up
Put rappers in quicksand, Dot leaned on em like kickstands
Im so hot, kids put me in their iPod
Even atheists play my shit and say, My God, Jesus, Joseph, and Mary, hes nice
Dont compare me to them, just compare me to Mike Jordan
When I record and the verse and the chorus is ill
You can land in lab of fortune when biting my skills, playa
Watch I lay-up bar after bar like Im trying to build a gate up
See me on the way up like an elevator, Imma let you take the stairs
That metaphor meaning Im already there 
Im in the booth with an apron
Cooking up shit like Martha Stewart was my bitch, Amen
Stay on the curb like a spray day tan?
Blowing herb with my nigga Herb, Fuck what you niggas heard
We the new West Coast Wu Tang bitch and Im the best
Think less, You can suck my dick
Who from the West can kill it like us? Give me their name
Now I take em to the house of pain, Top Dawg headquarters
Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel
You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me
Every MC, Im sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them
Let em die
Dead
Black Hippy
We dont give a fuck
Hell nah, nigga
This conglomerate so cool, Rock, we could freeze L.A., nigga
Black Hippy
Move in
Kendrick Lamar
I tell em like this
Ring the alarm or wake to a bomb
You aint a rapper, you Elton John, holding your john
I got a ton of croutons in the Louis Vuitton
Thats big bread, the chickens are flying, flocks when I come
Paul and Masson, half-drunk, stuck in a poem
Light matches underwater while Im bracing the storm
Im cool and Im calm, laid-back, smoking a farm
Socking the shit out of niggas til Im breaking my arm
Up in my zone, two blunts, cup of Patrón
.45 on me, shoot you if you fuck with me wrong
No homo, pause, thats your life and its going flatline
If you dont put your life in the song
I never drove a fast car, I almost ran over Tracy Chapman
She said, Drive slow; I said, Fuck off
Ab-Soul—whats up, yall? Other than youre subpar
Above all? Im a Heaven gate—above all, fucking great
And every time we in the stu
We cook that, chop that, whats that? Thats crack
Yeah, homie, this is what we do
3-1-0 shit, 3-2-3, bitch
Oww, nigga, welcome to the zoo, where we...
Cook that, chop that, whats that, thats crack
Yeah, homie, this is what we do
3-2-3 shit, 3-1-0, bitch!
The Black Hippys, the bag full, the bag empty
Spent it all at the car lot, then crash quickly
Im trying to come with enough power to pass Fifty
Im talking fifty bills—you niggas dont fit the bill
You niggas dont keep it real, you fake as Pamelas titties
I pound kitties, then hit the club with dogs with me
Tan Polos, no socks, chopped Dickies
Tan coupe, no top, bumping Biggie
Blowing sticky, before the group, been a hippy
Nifty-fifty, all blue, real Crippy
Big money, long stocks, ask Pippy
Mask on, one sock, I gets busy
I smoke Blacks, relax, and watch Walt Disney
Puff squares, pace in circles until Im dizzy
Speaking of Disney, fantasies, I had many
I used to hate on Mickey Mouse cause he had Minnie
Anyway, every time we in the stu
We cook that, chop that, whats that? Thats crack
Yeah, homie, this is what we do
3-1-0 shit, 3-2-3, bitch
Oww, nigga, welcome to the zoo, where we...
Cook that, chop that, whats that? Thats crack
Yeah, homie, this is what we do
3-2-3 shit, 3-1-0, bitch!
Ahhh, napped through my final, made enough, richer than Lionel
Fucking bitches on my job, coming harder than rhino
Breaking their spinal, laid-back, bumping my vinyl
Navigation on the scopes, easy to find em...
... Find you and Im right behind you, laid back, puffing a blunt
Gat on my lap, constantly talking shit; Ima dump
Your homies acting charged up, they can still get jumped
Take your chain, ash the kush for all you punks...
... However you want, whenever you want, you all can get it
Contagious, its mad syphilis, blazing, its God-giftedness
Die over death sentences, flow hot, plus, the beat knock
Like Jay witnesses, tell em I killed the witnesses...
... Gifted as twenty Christmases, itching to blow
Like twenty bitches with mouths that need a dick in it, wow
I ran rap for half a mile, then got tired
Laid down and realized that I was lying 
And every time we in the stu
We cook that, chop that, whats that? Thats crack
Yeah, homie, this is what we do
3-1-0 shit, 3-2-3, bitch
Oww, nigga, welcome to the zoo, where we...
Cook that, chop that, whats that, thats crack
Yeah, homie, this is what we do
3-2-3 shit, 3-1-0, bitch!
Back in the projects
Back in the projects
I lost it all, all, all, all
Now Im back in the projects
I cant get all of you in it
Big slugs, hardcore drugs
Everything crooked, what you thought this was?
Steam pot, turned powder into rock
Plan go sour, thats how you get got
Aww shit, got it poppin into bricks
Part of playing cool now its time to get rich
Keep in mind, never walk round blind
I cant get all of you in it
All that back and forth gets me hot sometimes
Wanna see somebody get knocked out, just box one time, shit
Catch a fade, catch a fade, it aint nothin
Get your head up, at the gym, bring your knuckles
Look, Im deep inside the projects where its brackin at
You know the zip
Where we take a quarter piece, flip it, til the corner lit
A1 yola, that fresh over the border shit
Shoot outs and abortions, situations so unfortunate
I knew a nigga, doin double digits, bust the head wide
For another nigga whos scared to rep his set right
Now in solitary, doin push ups by his bedside
All he want is a Green Dot, his homie keepin himself fly
Dont come around without your pass, niggas on they tip
Zero tolerance on niggas money, niggas want they shit
Dont start nothing without your blower, thats a one way trip
Six feet under, real life, thats all gunplay is
That is that hood shit
When young niggas on that misunderstood shit
Jumpin out of smokin rentals, Ks with the wood grips
Bitches for them bank statements will come and hit a full split
Dont you know no good, dont you know no good bitch?
Dont you know no good, dont you know no good bitch?
Dont you know no good, dont you know no good bitch?
Dont you know no good, dont you know no good bitch?
I cant get all of you in it
Niggas jaw-jacking, they aint on that hood shit
Bitch we bout that action, on that wish you would shit
All red flags, swag on ten
We aint in the club, we cant get our goods in
So we in the hood, lituations look grim
One time circlin for colors of your skin
Black lives matter out here, no way
Cops get promotions while the family gotta pray
Its fucked up, cant explain, babies all in a dump truck
Its all about that money mane, miss me with that Trump stuff
Tryna make a dollar outta fifteen, dont get fucked up
Its shake in the bag, get a bud then you lucked up
You fakin, you mad, you got a issue, you get fucked up
Get laid on yo ass, you feeling bad, your blunts crushed up
We in the set, just bickin it like the Cosbys
Tryna get dope, live happy days like Chachi
If you get a call from papi, thats like Jesus callin
All you do is execute, next ten seasons ballin
You can get the world, stay loyal, why you even trip?
Dont you know no good, dont you know no good bitch?
Dont you know no good, dont you know no good bitch?
Dont you know no good, dont you know no good bitch?
Dont you know no good, dont you know no good bitch?
I cant get all of you in it
Take a trip with the narcoleptic
Suffered insomnia, but this time it was only seconds
I see thermometers boil as you lay in the desert
Of eternal fire hate ya then deny yourself of a blessin
Meanwhile Im on a new cloud chunking the deuce
Renewed vows with sinners, homies, enemies too
Gold towel under my feet clicking the fluke
With a thousand troops, Crip and Piru, nigga, woop, woop
Love I depend on, white doves I depend on
They flying through this endzone that meant on to vent on
So listen, homie, you miss me with that bullshit
I keep my distance, homie, I am on a higher pulprit
You cannot visit, homie
I mean the beauty of heaven is far for me not to exit
Its ike an anti-depressant, you see the vision, homie?
I mean this godly advice, fucking right
Even if you pinch me twice, yes I, keep dreaming
Lovely lullabies
I dont see another thing but starry skies
And louds of clouds beneath my wings and in the skies
As far as hazy as can see the sun will rise
And illuminate this life, this life
Oh why do I have to return to reality?
Oh why, this time Ill try
Ill try not to wake up from this dream
I’ll try not to wake up from this dream
I won’t wake up from this dream
I can’t wake up from this dream
I won’t wake up from this dream
I will not forget
Fixating the part of faith Ive never met
And explaining away the reasons as I slept
So beautiful here I wish I never left
I never know which ones a lie, this life
Oh why do I have to return to reality?
Oh why, this time Ill try
Ill try not to wake up from this dream
I wont wake up from this dream
I cant wake up from this dream
I wont wake up from this dream
I wont open my eyes again, Ill keep them shut
I wont open my eyes again, Ill keep them shut
I wont open my eyes again, Ill keep them shut
I wont open my eyes again, Ill keep them shut
To wake up from this dream
I won’t wake up from this dream
Abazaba

So enticing
On point like the helmet of a Viking
Kicking up dust like Im hiking
I aint calling a woman a bitch on this one
I be calling my woman so I could get some
She fresh off work and Lord knows it was hard
She take off her shirt and Lord knows that Im hard
Composing myself, tryna remain content
She had a long day and plus I know she wanna vent
Now she could talk about her boss and I can give advice
Or she could take the panties off and I could eat the 
Fuck that, option number deuce
On the kitchen table while I play this tune

We be in the car, bumpin my latest jam
I recorded at the studio around 10 p.m
Its a club banger
Catchy hooks and 808s
I even threw a bridge on it just to play it safe
The first 8 bars, shes lovin the track
Even rewinding it back
Soon as the beat drop
The way she react she like Thats Hot
Til I start talkin bout how many hoes I got
How many I fucked
How many Ive misled just to get a nut
Like a squirrel, in pursuit of lunch
Uh
Though Im on some cliché rapper shit
I know she thinking are my lyrics that accurate
Shes so cool doe
Dont downplay her just to fuck up the mood yo
Shell still play it even though I sound rude yo
And disregards to the provocative records
One thing that I do know

Thisll be my girlfriends joint right here
So Imma kick the shit she like

Like a pair of jeans that fit tight
Around her cute booty
I like to hold her from behind in line
At the movies
Her body language gets read
Like a ruby
Cause she a work-a-art
No help from Julie
Imma beast and she such a beauty
I love her, she know that, I place no one above her
Far from an arc, but best undercover
Kodak moment every time we in sync
Like a iPod plugged to a USB
Its just you and me
I mean me and her
I mean her and I
Its plain to see, affirmative
So if you ever need me
You know where Herbert is
On her mind

Now Im sho to get some cuddy
Ladies and gentlemen! My man, Kendrick Lamar!
Livin in America
Thuggin in the trap
Livin in a groove
Watchin TV
Dedicated to the homies in the pen, hit me!
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water dont go dry, yay yay
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
Uh, when you lookin at me, uh, tell me what do you see?
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy think they high
Uh, one day at a time, sun gon shine
Everybody lookin at you crazy 
What you gon do? 
Lift up your head and keep moving 
Or let the paranoia haunt you? 
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, huh
Uh, when you lookin at me, tell me what do you see?
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
Uh, illuminated hands of God, boy dont seem shy
One day at a time, sun gon shine
When they say its a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line full of fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme
Ah man
Uh, dreams of realitys peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, the wind could cry now
The strong in me, I still smile
Huh, when you lookin at me, uh, tell me what do you see?
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy dont be shy
One day at a time, sun gon shine, everybody, hit me!

Oh man, hey check this out, this a real Compton thing goin on right now, ya feel what Im talkin bout? Ya dig that? Sometimes I just get a little bit beside myself, you know what Im talkin bout? This heres the return of Enoch, and we gonna do it to you like this, here we go: one, two, three, hit me!
And I love myself
I love myself
I love myself
I love myself
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, dont nobody call a medic
Ima do it till I get it right
War last night
Ive been dealing with depression, duckin every other blessin
I could never see the message, I could--
I could never take the lead, never bob and weave
Negative letting them annihilate me
Evident Im moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my--
Money in the ceiling lay my body in the street
Glory to the feeling of the holy unseen
Glory to the feeling of the holy unseen
Seen enough, make everybody scream, I love myself!
I lost my head
I mustve misread what the good book said
Oh woes keep me, its a jungle inside
Give myself again til the well runs dry
Ah man, ay, ay homie, I told you its a straight up Compton thing, ya dig what Im talkin bout? And this here is dedicated to the homies. Yall feel what Im saying? And sometimes I just get beside myself. The return of the Enoch is back, you hear what Im talkin bout?
Uh, Ive been lookin for you my whole life, appetite
For this feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
In a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Somethings got me losing my mind
Where you at? From the front to the back
Im lookin for you, I react only when you react
I thought I found you back in the ghetto
When I was 17 with the .38 Special
Maybe youre in a dollar bill, maybe youre not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe Im paranoid, ha, maybe I dont need you anyway
Dont lie to me, Im suicidal any day
I could be your advocate
I could speak for you if you tell me what the matter is
I could preach for you with the mighty tongue
Im the one, how can I, overcome
Negative energy while I give infinitely and survive?!
The- the- the reason that Im breathin
Seeping heat, it gets me cheese, why Im eaten in Bad Season
Was deep in beef and was needing some beats to release in evenings
Instead of me being up and bleeding with thieves and heathens with keys and obstacles
Made it possible for the flow go to be profitable
Yo Techs audible, his inaugural prada popped and was plausible
God is so good for giving me music!
Liftin, gettin me through when I was fixing to lose it
Dudes hit Big Scoobs shit and reppin the blue tip
Fools skipped when Scoob scritch, we jumped in the 2 whip
Full clips for who stick the homie for true grit
My crew, thanks to music, we all living through it
Got me out of the ghetto, got me mucho dinero
In Cozumel, Mexico shorts and Jordans and a sombrero
This gift aint given from a devil, so settle
Come and get this rebel music thats hot as a kettle, pendejo
Saved my life, paid my lights, made my wife, say Bye Bye
Gave my night babes, I like preyed my mic
Would never fade, forever slayed, days I write
My cheddar raised up better, faze way high hyped
My musics one reason I always get to lay my pipe
The reason Tech N9na can comfortably say Night, night
Blessed me with original flow, so hey! Why bite?
I hear, I feel, I live, listen and learn
I like...
Yeah, I love 
For real 
And I need 
To feel 
Go and play it 
Yeah, know what Im saying? 
My love 
Know what Im saying?
Automatic when I do this manually
Daily, monthly, annually
I get a step closer to being the coolest
Acoustic got me foolin and about to lose it, ooh, sh-
Jump in the grind, and my hom Mean Mike produced it
Thats music pahtna
Im just a poet with incredible rhythm
Words arranged will let you know he has incredible in him
I dont mean to toot my own horn, but toot toot, ha ha
I laugh because its easier than do ray mi fa sol la
Ti do, we know he go say what on that C Note
And he can pay a C Note with that B Note
Im talkin truth
And I got stories that I show you that its walkin proof
A thousand miles of it and I can show you what Im walkin through
Music aint a hobby, its an organ of my body that the creator provided back in January of 92
So dont you dare say good music skipped my generation
Your hatin aint nothin but motivation for these compilations
Oob!
Yeah, it feeds me 
I need 
To feel 
You know what Im sayin 
Its my thing 
Go and sing 
And I love 
Yeah, go ahead
Music is my life
The reason why I write
Like Edgar Allan Poe on the beat, like a parasite
You thought a parachute made my flow just fall out the sky
Then you fell apart into a body part no one would buy
Nobody tried my limits cause theyre afraid of heights
The ambition, weak or gravity, let em die
I let you live until a nigga compose a rhyme
Then its like a rhino in your ass every time
Time and time again I treat my pen like The Pen
Bars harder than Pelican Bay and I been
Servin a life sentence since the day I was ten
Nine times outta ten you only ten songs deep before you leap
Into a pool of sharks then swim
Thats an analogy on the way I do casualties
And I do this shit casually, before the verse end
Ill be in the Hall of Fame with my picture framed, friend
And if it wasnt for my music I wouldnt be standing here!
If it wasnt for my music you wouldnt have nothing to hear, yeah
And I love...
I need it to live 
 
Yeah, and I love it 
Imma be quiet 
Ssh
And I love it 
Show enough love 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Wake up!!!
I swear you people dont know Kendrick, you dont know him
But you say you want some more Kendrick, Im bout to show em
Everything inside this human being, Im still growing
Im a premature baby in this crazy life that we adore
Doors on the Lamborghini, I want em
Cant afford em so I tell the swap meet to clone em
I guess I really am a vanity slave
I guess my ancestors turning in they graves
Burning money when I get it, fuck a life savings
Overdraft bank statements, just to make a statement
When I put this fashion on, Im a fashion junkie
Picking cotton in the country, I bought this out the country
Whips and chains, whips and chains, Jacob know my name
He call me Kunta, you my brother, we come from the same modern world
Thats ya girl? I see she rocking Fendi
Try this on
If it aint upscale then you may offend me
Copping everything in sight, ignoring they sacrifice
Amnesia if I see the black visa in my hand tonight
I show my dick and then I swipe, thats a punchline
They was hot and I wore ice, thats ironic huh?
Word around town that Im all about the bitches
Word around town that I love my 26s
Word around town that I gotta stay paid
Lord please forgive me Im a vanity slave
Its the Gucci cock and shoot
Found my swag but lost my roof, 
Lord please forgive me Im a vanity slave
See my Audemar tick, as my Audemar tock
Lord please forgive me Im a vanity slave
Aw man videos got me wanting hoes
Appetite for flashing lights, all I can do is pose
A black male... on Melrose. I should get blackmailed
By my people hell rose, Niggas that aint had shit
For 400 years overcompensate by over accessorizing with gear
Man yall dont see my vision
I do it for the love of hip hop and the love of bitches
Am I a hypocrite cause everyday Im contradicting
I think of how Im living, then I watch How Im Living I know this cant be right
My conscience tell me to stay righteous
Its unlikely to see what I like and say I dont like it
Biggest dilemma my priorities ignoring me, I wanna move accordingly
But baby steps are premature remember?
Im flying to the south and Ill be gone til November
To see my family tree but this a shame Im yelling, out, timber
Word around town that Im all about the bitches
Word around town that I love my 26s
Word around town that I gotta stay paid
Lord please forgive me Im a vanity slave
Its the Gucci cock and shoot
Found my swag but lost my roof, 
Lord please forgive me Im a vanity slave
See my Audemar tick, as my Audemar tock
Lord please forgive me Im a vanity slave
Cold, oh so cold
How ironic he bought it then sold his soul
Is it masonic for your vice to take its toll?
The remote control is taking control
Lift up the doors
That Lamborghini I wanted come with a dumb ass model that in vogue
I like em both, Ill wife em both
Take these motherfucking Jordans off, put on my loafs
Cause nothing goes bad, everytime I wear 
Im getting more ass, everytime I wear 
They told me its a fad, everytime I wear 
But should I give a fuck when it bring me more coochie?
This a young niggas pedigree, I pray the lord can better me
If not he bout to strike me down like this my third felony
The voices keep on telling me, Kendrick dont forget about us
I burned my wardrobe, hoping that I could live without it
Word around town that Im all about the bitches
Word around town that I love my 26s
Word around town that I gotta stay paid
Lord please forgive me Im a vanity slave
Its the Gucci cock and shoot
Found my swag but lost my roof, 
Lord please forgive me Im a vanity slave
See my Audemar tick, as my Audemar tock
Lord please forgive me Im a vanity slave

H-H-H-Hell yeah
Rollin’ in a broken Mitsubishi with no AC
And a couple stolen TV’s and a seatbelt for my safety
Play the passenger, I think it’s five years after eighty-
Seven, do that math, 92, don’t you be lazy
I’m looking out the window, notice all the essentials
Of a block party that stopped for a second
Then it rekindled like the flame from a trick candle
Everybody got dental insurance, ‘cause we bout to floss
You get the couch I sent you?
I heard that from a block away, probably had credentials
Of a scholar, but should not today
Them Dayton spokes was his to take
Refrigerators, barbecue pits, and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
Hello, my Mr. Myiagi, I want them Kenwood Woofers
Say that you got me
If not, I’ll dig in your drawer for it
The swap meet was the bullseye like a Taurus is
Murder was the melody, you should know what the chorus is
You really telling me we can just get some more of it if we run out?
He said “Lil nigga, today the poor is rich”
Dont tell your mom that you seen a molotov bomb
And if she asks, just know that you have to lie
And son, don’t forget:
You from Compton
Brace yourself, I take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I’m slinging brick and moving cane
Cul de sac and plenty Cognac in major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that’s weighing on your brain
It was me, O-Boog and Yaya
Lucky, ride down Rosecrans
Ugly, waving yo hand out the window, brace yourself, uh
Warriors and Conans
Euphoria can slow dance
Society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed
Light skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different
That was back when I was nine
Joey packed a nine
Pakistan on every porch, it’s fine
We adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
Sliding door, fuck is up?
Fucking shooting forth, if you aint walking up, you fucking punk
Picking up the fucking pump
Picking off you suckers, suck a dick
Die a sucker punch, a ball of bullets coming from
AK’s, AR’s, Aye y’all; duck
That’s what Mama said when we was eatin’ that free lunch
Aw man, god damn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in ‘94, fuck yo truce
Now crawl yo head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
And no peace treaties just peace and BG’s appearing to prove
Bodies on top of bodies, IV’s on top of IV’s
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolly, your color’s correct
Make sure each corporate knows they’ll be calling your mother collect
Now, what you expect?
My life is a threat
Good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Life or death, is you with me?
Tim Westwood, whats up
Where are you going now?
Why are you slowing down?
Why, why, why?
Where are we going?
Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going?
We should be growing now!
Try and visualize how to get it right
But my visions so blurry
Tryna slow it down
Take us to the ground
But were always in a hurry now!
And if I could make this world spin a little slower
Then I would, and we could grow a little closer
I think we’re getting closer
Where are we going?
Why are we slowing?
We think we’re getting closer
Where are you going?
We should be growing now
Where are we going?
Why are we slowing?
We think we’re getting closer
Where are you going?
We should be growing now
So in conclusion
Sometimes we lose focus
Planning our whole demise
We’re getting the big picture and making it the wallet size
So to whats important in my life, I apologize
I hope to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
We all get distracted
The question is would you bounce back, or bounce back wards?
You wouldn’t know how to act or would you take action?
Thats just a part of life and if your visions impaired
Youll probably lose it all tonight
What’s going on Marvin, dearly departed?
Young Marta, Bar or Parker
Upon them all upon mighty days
But sweet alcoholic nights are feeling faraway
Son can only Skype with his pop, stop
He’s only feeling love from his mom
Got rocks in my stomach
I can feel my soul bleed, self-love
But I never want my son to be me, holla at me
So I pray until I feel it’s not working
I’m a showman on the surface
Either way, it’s perfect
You ever feel like the purpose aint worth it?
Well I do, I’m the poster child for young fathers working
I swear to god I wanna be free
And he just wanna be me
And I just wanna be him
I’m jealous and discreetly
I’m one of your own
I’m trying to raise a child
Still trying to raise me right now
Where am I gone?
Try and visualize how to get it right
But my visions are blurry
Trying to slow it down
Stay close to the ground
But we were always in a hurry now
And if I could make this world spin a little slower
Then I would, and we could grow a little closer
Where are we going?
Why?
Why are you going?
Why are we growing apart?
We should be growing together?
Right?
Goddamn, look who just stepped in
The cat done drug up a wolf from the den, hey
Not long ago I was wiping his ass
Now hes a rich rapper wiping his ass with cash
It didnt take much for me to realize I was on my own
Moving through woods like Donkey Kong
I invented that classic rock soul
My momma was too inhibited with brothers and black crows
We got the dirty shit locked in the boon docks
Grain fed cattle means we gon shroom pop
Im in touch with my inner star, you watch
Ill stand up in Hollywood and spit moon rocks
Bitches wanna know the real Yelawolf, really?
All the whore will get to see is Catfish Billy
The world around my childhood was a crooked wall
I had to reach high to see above the weed fog
Pop a head on the crawfish and soak it dry
I pop your head if you talk shit, I bust your eye
You know Im southern, I got a grill and a dirty frown
Yall coming with me, Im the future in town
Its going down, Shady
What up? Lemme catch the beat
What up? Swag, swag, Based God I hear you
What up? Swag, swag, yeah, G shit
Westside, huh, look
Im beyond the most slept on, stepped on
Stepsons, father of rap songs, writing my wrongs
Writing in the book of psalms
This is the word, word to the holy Quran
Or whatever thats foreign to ya
I find it funny that you are embracing a storm, wait
Ring the alarm or wake up with a bomb through ya
Its Baghdad kids with bad dads, cops with bad badges
Big bullets, no My bads once them guns shoot ya
I said, Yo, I might go hard as the Mike Jordan
Lace up my Jordans and yellin out ISO
Ike Turner your idol, whip em and bruise em
Stick poison inside his pie-hole, sad that you knew him
We influence the heart of thousands, 999,000, but whos counting
Thirsty for success and we drink from the youth fountain
Big headed, tryna stay grounded like a delinquent in middle school clownin
Drownin MCs, they want life jackets
While we swim backwards we yellin Nigga, please!
Pay your respect or recognize the alphabet
You cant survive in a room full of gs
Coached by my uncle, Lil Mane, I resemble him
They tryna tilt the game and we killing all Thebes
Make em all blood, make em all bleed
Motherfucker die, put a ribbon in the sky
Till Stevie Wonder sing, king of all kings
Jokers and new jacks can get dealt with
Royal flush when I drop shit and say these things
Mad leaning on em cause half of these niggas Maybelline
All made up, bout to go dummy
On a dummy, what, what, treat him like a welterweight
And stuff him in some trunks, you fucking with a giant
Im Forest Whitaker sparring with some Forrest Gumps
What you want?
Look how good I look, man, its Lil B
Yeah, ayy, check this, uh
My nigga told me if I ever stop rapping
The game lost Jordan, trade him to the Magic
Exhibit Based not Exhibit C
Niggas couldnt see, let me part the sea
Part a part of me, nothing pardons me
You niggas arguably is worse than me
Get your whole squad, let me go hearse your team
Pop bullets in his back, make him work his knees
This is sick Im on top now
I remember in the hood I was locked down Oakland, Yosemite
Having YA dreams appearing right ahead of me
Now Im getting glad that you niggas aint ahead of me
And youll never be forgetting me
Hard drive, man, its all about the memory
Strapped with a vest screaming Motherfuck my enemies
Uh, have em moving like a centipede
Im the weed-man so you know I got the remedy
Plus Im a user, dope-fiend music
Plus Im a robber and I dare you suckas push me
Got the same pistol that they shooting—
Im too nice
Im the rawest rapper, Im done, Im done
Yeah
Nah, I aint done no faking but here come the H-game
We were the shit before the cake came
I hate lames, they get mad because we make change
And I aint even had to bake caine
But I keep the weight gain on the freight train
Fuck dope, Im on the kush and the haze game
In the streets I got a great name
Im a pimp cause I break dames
Play with my pay, I see my great danes
Pause, let the bass bang, huh
Trapping was cool till the J came
Then they found a couple tools and the ye, damn
Then niggas change colors like a fake chain
Prince of the South, hoe, you wont catch me without Dro
Im like T.I., pimpings in my genes, and aint talking bout Levis
I keep the kush and like the couch fold
And the toy like G.I. Joe
Bet a G I. blow
You pussy niggas wanna fight? I be outdoors
The devil stay right, Ali eat, yall close
Cause Im swinging the three plus three-five Os
We got chickens nigga E-I-O

And I aint fucking with you niggas cause I see yall hoes
CyHi, lets get it 
Good mills, ayy, ha-ha 
XXL, baby, Freshmen,
This, this, this
Should be played at high volume
Preferably in a residential
Life’s a bitch, life’s a bitch
But I’mma keep the pussy wet 
I’mma keep the pussy wet 
I’mma keep the pussy wet 
I’mma keep the pussy wet 
My dick hard, her pussy wet
And I’m born with my dick in the earth
You can tell me how much am I worth
I’mma die with my heart on my sleeve
Many die on their hands and their knees
And I’m takin’ whatever I need
And I’m raping the government fees
And you’re wasting your time
And I’m speaking my mind on whatever I think
And I think that I’m Richard Pryor
With priors of 32 fiends
And that means that I hear for higher
Tell me why are you starin’ at me?
Matta fact, man, your eyes is wired
You inspired by Kendrick the king
Maybe it’s ’cause I’m living my dream
Man, I sing what I’m living about
And the words that come out of my mouth
They requires a random routine
Of being organic granite
Then my access is granted
To represent the shit that I conceive
And I guarantee that I’mma bring
My mind, body, soul
And I sold all these records off bein’ myself
And I wish you can do the same thing, man
It’s easier than a stripper
Or tyin’ a baby shoestring, you stringing along
And really why you writing a song?
Your passion for music is never in sync
No secret societies guided me to the world of unseen
And they tell me life is a bitch, who gives a shit?
Youll get relief
I’mma keep the pussy wet 
I’mma keep the pussy wet 
My dick hard, her pussy wet
Imma keep the pussy wet 
 I came
 I went
 I came
 I went
 I came
 I went
And I see that you envy of me
Enemigos don’t prosper
Better yet, they do die eventually
If I’m at the event you will leave
‘Cause you know and I know that
I go ham even if Muslims is seen
In my rearview I’m near you
But I don’t hear you, can you at least breathe?
With an oxygen mask, and
The masses keep saying I’m speaking for them
And if you can imagine my madness
Then you can see where I’ve been
And the places the Louis has been
And I swear I been doing this when
You was in pajamas, watching B-Barney and Friends
And you couldn’t harm me even with ten
Weapons of your choice riding in
Army tanks, you shot blanks
And I shot back, make your duplex bend
What the fuck you think? If I don’t think
Then I’m right back where the city sin
What the fuck you drink?
Thinking I can’t write these raps in the Lions’ Den
When I hear that you lyin’, then?
It’s murder she wrote, ain’t no hope
You go downhill, man, where’s your slope?
Get thrown downhill tied to a rope
Tell the world to put intervals
Man, I swear this the anecdote
And they tell me that life is a bitch
Who gives a shit when you know?
And I see that you envy of me
Don’t prosper, better yet, they do die eventually
Cause you know and I know that I go ham even if Muslims is seen
In my rearview I’m near you
But I dont hear you, can you at least breathe?
Baby, I come running
Baby, I come running
Just keep me coming 
And I come running

And I come running

So you can talk to me, dont listen to him 
A body like that aint hard to feed
Cause girl Ill eat you up
All in a couple of seconds
Girl Ill eat you up 
Its when you realize youre in Heaven
Like howd you get there?
Baby what you doin in this chair? 
Couldnt let you sit there
You need help, somebody should get there
You see girl, time is like money
Both of which men love
Spend them both with me
=And then for sure youll know
Baby, I come running
Baby, I come running
Just keep me coming
And I come running
Cause Im your dog
Baby Im your dog
So whenever you call

Cause Im your dog
Baby Im your dog
So whenever you call

Uh
Shes impressed by a fat boy
Cadillac, weed, pistol on his lap, boy
Home run hitter, thought I was a batboy
Search warrant for the crib, you better get a map for it
Paid for, meanin I aint gotta rap for it
She a alley oop, I tap it off the backboard
Hustlin, baby what you lookin for? Just ask for it
Blue Ferrari, Im the envy of the task force
Impeccable suits, as I run with my dogs
Pinkie rings and things that come with my wonderful job
Dogg pound niggas, and we came to fight
I was several million up before it came to light
Now they callin me the truest one to ever do it

Motherfucker this is Watts, California
Gangbang murder state
 Shit, just the same old same old
Same fiends in the hood, chasing the best dope
Project hustling, chasing them pesos
Its a struggle everyday, man, you know how this shit goes
But my demeanorll never switch, cherry red beamer
Gangbanged the fuck out, red rag around the nina
No doubt, Im living it
Been claiming the set since the year found Snoop innocent
Slanging hard rock when the rap game was ran by Timberlands
The cortez is back, wheres my strap?
Lemme put a hole in em, and whats concealed in the black denim
Will rock em to sleep like I babysit em
I seen it all - loyalty, betrayal, envy
My close homie died in my arms
12 hundred project units under the sun
Aint about where you at, its about where youre from
Welcome to Watts, California
Where we aint scared to run up on ya
You aint prepared when it go down
You already dead right about now
Welcome to Watts, California
Where we aint scared to run up on ya
If youre prepared when it go down
Then you know its Jay Rock turn now
The homie told me, Put your feelings aside
But since I got signed I been feeling the Vibes
Niggas play the background and screw they face all day
Wanna walk in my shoes, wanna take my place
So at any given time they might take my life
So I take the .38 when I ride at night
Broad day, no exempt, niggas kill you when the sun is out
Make sure your gun is out or stay inside your mama house
Its that real, you dont feel me yet?
Fine, niggas, drop the beat and just let me vent
No mask on, fuck around and kill your whole squad
Be the last person you see before you meet God
Keep the rifle on top of the tripod
Aim art, if you live your body might need parts
Jay Rock, putting it down for Top Dawg
From the bottom to the top, we shooting straight to the stars
Welcome to Watts, California
Where we aint scared to run up on ya
You aint prepared when it go down
You already dead right about now
Welcome to Watts, California
Where we aint scared to run up on ya
If youre prepared when it go down
Then you know its Jay Rock turn now
A nigga so goddamn stressed out
I feel like fuck everything right now
See Ive been broke too long, cant find a job to save my life
But Ill be damned if I give em my handout
See my pride is one thing I will not put aside
Im too proud to beg, Im sorry Left Eye
If I dont make it in life, motherfucker I tried
What? Uh
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Nobody, nobody but you
So it feels like, like its only you
So Im feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
It seems like, you cant win for losing
Whatever youre doing turns out to be what-are-you-doing?
Sick of pursuing, that your time will soon come
Nobody knows the position that you in
But its a million people out there thats going through the same thing
That feeling, hard to explain
When you just, just want to get away
Something like
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Nobody, nobody but you
So it feels like, like its only you
So Im feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
Away from it all
Take me out of Hell where only Heaven can visit
The smartest astronomers, they wont even see my vision
Im stuck on the studio couch now, thinking bout my daughter
Times is getting harder, another beat is slaughtered
Just press record or, seems like I need a mill to keep my shit in order
Instead of problem solving
From my hat to my shoes, spirit laced with pride
Set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes
Reaching for the skies, pissing on a cloud
Shitting on a birds head, higher than a dread
As I fly through the galaxy, pain and the agony
Nothingness surrounding me, living my life
Though its better to write
Configuring my style to the streets, bring dark to the light
So how you feel? My nigga, I keep it real
A Schoolboy soon to be star, Mr. Lamar
So Im feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
Watch how I kill them with the funky rhythm
Embalming fluid fill em
Piranhas in em
Peep my persona as I
Get deep as Nostradamus
You stalling? Like the 89 I-I-Isiah Thomas
Im ballin, cut up your pajamas if you sleepin on me
I promise no peekin homie you tryin to confiscate the flow, I know
So, I switch it quicker than my bitches in mini skirts that want your attention
One thing for sure, they gon get it
Im cursed with the worlds negatives
Probably thinkin Im hurt but thats the only way I can live
More money, cash, drugs, got me feeling like Ace walking inside the club
Paid in Full, MOB license plates
38s slug hugging my waist like it had arms
Then I bear it so I guess it really does
No paper work on this marriage, but Im in love with life corruptions rather than life 
Oh, you aint know? I need that
More money, more drugs I need that
More murder, more guns I need that, wondering how I live with the worlds negatives
This the last days my nigga
We livin in the life where crime pays my nigga
So all I can say is get paid my nigga
Money ,murder, or dope which one you love most?
Mamacita had a bangin body
Drove a black beamer, present from her baby daddy probably
He knew the nigga from high school
10th grade? they was cool, fell out over a dice game
She knew that but still wanted him to penetrate through that
Shorty wait, me and your man go way back
She said so what? He dont need to know what go on between us besides, I just wanna fuck
She blew his mind
Know what? we can exchange digits
Lets hook up later pay one of them hotels a visit
She seemed more than interested, more like desperate to be intimate
Either she this polite or his lucky night
Got the champagne sittin on ice
Room 112 fuckin all night then interrupted by her baby daddy and some niggas that he fuck with
Got him for everything, pussys a negative
Adam & Eve, he shouldve known
Oh you aint know? you need that
More pussy, more hoes you need that
Even if its dirty pussy you need that
Wondering how he lives with the worlds negatives
This the last days my nigga
We livin in the life where crime pays my nigga
So all I can say is get paid my nigga
Money ,murder, or dope which one you love most?
We livin in hell waiting on heaven but you dont know so
Might as well try to accept it, go with the flow oh
This life will never change 
So Im gonna do my thing 
Seems like we never see home, you know?
So we screaming
This life will never change 
So Im gonna do my thing 
Goes out to everybody that know about bad habits
And willing to accept them as a fatal attraction, what a reaction
Rolling with the punches that life gives us and end up like Ke$has
Liver cirrhosis, matches givin us cancer
Bitches givin us gono-rrhea
I promise to practice safe sex, momma, dont cry
They say the good die young but a crackhead live a long time
So I crack open a beer keg, take that bitch to the head
Sippin it slow hopin it prolongs my soul
And thats crazy yo
When heat is on, I put on a coat
Then take it off when its about to get cold
Ive adapted to my environment, murder environment
20 years worth of it so I gotta love it, you cant blame me
Negative energy, public pulled by evil string
As I open a bible I start to sing
Liquors invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off momma forgive me
I cant be held accountable that negatives be gettin me down
Got me rolling with guys, making gs
Got me tellin lies that sound true come test me
This the last days my nigga
We livin in the life where crime pays my nigga
So all I can say is get paid my nigga
Money ,murder, or dope which one you love most?
We livin in hell waiting on heaven but you dont know so
Might as well try to accept it, go with the flow oh
This life will never change 
So Im gonna do my thing 
Seems like we never see home, you know?
So we screaming
This life will never change 
So Im gonna do my thing
Life make a nigga wanna yell out
Change for that fame, how some niggas turn sell out
Too old for my mama crib, Im tryin to get the hell out
Stayin out these cells but we working on that bailout
Help out, please. Sure is hard livin without cheese
Aint shit in my pocket only these house keys
They pray for a nigga but yet they doubt me
Thats why Im out getting higher than balconies
But no I wont jump, being broke is childish and boy Im grown up
My money runnin late tho so boy I wont front
When my paper finally make you should know Im gonna stunt
So, hard
My God, my life is such turmoil
Cant save me tonight cause times is hard now
I know you tell me dont let my guard down
I gotta get it my nigga
Never believe what they say
Man, I gotta get paid
Dawg its so damn amazing
How Imma shock the World
Imma shock the World
Hell naw I aint lying
Yea, I gotta get mine
Dawg it’s about time
So Imma shock the world
So Imma shock the world
Stare inside of the soul of Kendrick
While I stare inside the solar, system hopin I soak up
Enough game to play 3 systems with one controller and remain sane and remain unsober
Was closer to my dreams but reality actually told me hold up
No money in my jeans and my salary said you owe us
Cant pay them taxes, laid on that matress and feel colder than a polar bear
But this bear was in California
So I felt out a pocket and then a piece of lint fell out my pocket
A broke opportunist all in my optics
And you could see it even when Im Sleep
My screws loose, I hate when loose change fall in them seats
Because I need every dime like Magic Johnson
Or Hugh Hefner living in his prime
Prime example of youngin on his grind
This the life of a Compton nigga
I know the vanities of the world like the promise niggas
Thats why we crooked, in yo bushes where you find us nigga
You better scramble before you fold like an omelet nigga
This aint insomnic nigga and that means I dont need Busters to front on me
A Bible in my pocket Im walkin like its a gun on me
So when I catch a fade they know to put more than one on me
Fear no evil, I can still see Regals pullin up
Niggas tuck like a baby in fetal, position
If you listen you can hear the city needs you
Thats what my mind said
But my big head is tellin me that Im a black Beatle
Until my number is called and someone yell bingo
A shadow in the dark, park the coupe
Then recoup with the homeless in the park, Kendrick Lamar
Im in the studio
All day all night
Cookin up the flow
Gettin my career right
As I should
Tryna get my mama up out the hood
So dont blame me if I hustle like Im broke
Cause all my life Ive been broke
Im K-Dot if you didnt know
Aiming straight for the top
Hub City beat
87 baby 87 Cudi screamin out Fuck the police
Bubble kush in the trunk, choppers in the front seat
Get your top peeled back, dont chitterchat, dont speak of me
I move low-key, I think like a double OG
Inside of an old school bumpin oldies
So high off life, that bitch I could OD
Die twice, and come back the same nigga
Lame niggas get up out of my lane nigga
Before the big rig come through and run over your brain nigga
Me propane niggas for their dividends
Forgive you innocent, Compton all of my uncles wore Pendletons
West Coast rider, bitch Imma ride her
Til the wheels fall off, buy more tires
Mmm, say hello to the new prince
Im high king behind black tint
Namean?
Im in the studio
All day all night
Cookin up the flow
Gettin my career right
As I should
Tryna get my mama up out the hood
So dont blame me if I hustle like Im broke
Cause all my life Ive been broke
Im K-Dot if you didnt know
Aiming straight for the top
Get the fuck out of my business
Because Ive been handling the fuck out of my business
Grinding got perfect attendance
Flyer than first-class and detention
Uh, been a winner since the beginning
And my records show, not even in the Guinness
What do you mean, am I finished? Im just getting started
But youre on the sideline like Vince Lombardi
Weezy, new born baby? and its my party
And Im kicking like a horse on the stick-shift Ferrarri
Like new cocaine, bright yellow dope?
Bright red flag like a red velvet rope
Open for criticism, there really isnt any room for criticism
When this shit is in Im in deeper than your pool, so I swim in towel-less
Bitch, I be and I been ballin
Im in the studio
All day all night
Cookin up the flow
Gettin my career right
As I should
Tryna get my mama up out the hood
So dont blame me if I hustle like Im broke
Cause all my life Ive been broke
Im K-Dot if you didnt know
Aiming straight for the top
Mmm, fuck em all, kill em all off
Send em off to the holy one
Put a hole in one, like miniature golf
Price on your head, and they trying to purchase
No matter the cost
Hand over the cloth
Cloth over the gun
Gun over your jaw
Bullet over your tongue
Stick my dick inside hip-hop and shortys sprung
Every time I get a chance to come over I overcome
Over the snare drums
They say, Who fucking with you if you the god MC?
I tell em none
Get it? I tell em none
Catholic nor Christian, holding the book of sums
In the back of my True Religions
Never passed the bar but
I aint got to study law
Just to judge lyrics
Mmm, I should be the judge of lyrics
Bang the gavel, give you a life sentence
Im in the studio
All day all night
Cookin up the flow
Gettin my career right
As I should
Tryna get my mama up out the hood
So dont blame me if I hustle like Im broke
Cause all my life Ive been broke
Im K-Dot if you didnt know
Aiming straight for the top
Soundwave, I feel we, put together
Some of the most beautiful music my nigga
Real talk, feels so good
Lets get this money
I feel like rapping tonight people
Can I rap a little?
Dont be mad..
Cuz Im young and Im black and my hats real low
If you dont like my lyrics you can press fast forward
Look, why I always feel that Im hot?
Why I always feel I should drop another jewel
Like Martin on Blue Streak while you dudes get tattooed
With permanent scars, Im always bullying yall
Im always righteous to think that life is what you make it
Im always thinking of R&B bitches butt-naked
Im always on point, like a snitch on the go
But I never snitch my cars the only thing I towed on
Im always keeping it moving, middle finger up
Like I practice celibacy, I dont give a fuck
Just wait, Im at they heads like a toupee yeah
Its like that, your cranium never survive titanium bars
Harder than my dick when the tip gets licked, quick
Run for cover like winters here then listen here
K. Dot youll never shake me loose
Like a tied knot off the goose, you mad at me too?
Cause Im young and Im black and my hats real low 
If you dont like my lyrics you can press fast forward
I cant front, I cant front sometimes I feel like..
Yo, why you always critiquing my shit
Why dont you hop on your own dick like Marilyn Manson
Im dancing with 2 brains, so if I got shot in the head
I wont die Ill just lose more game, propane walking
You could sell my words at an auction for the right price
And be rich your whole life, straight up
I wanna see the world by 35 but for right now Im Compton bound
Hit Rosecrans with a pocket full of dividends
Big truck speed through the light, run over civilians
Pimp cut bitch on my right, hat low like a stripper ass
When she hit the floor, doing my thing, why you complain?
Cause Im young and Im black and I rap like a nigga got a
Angel on his back, wait a minute I means business
You homosexual with it, I give you straight lyrics
Now thats an emcee, thats why you mad at me?
Cause Im young and Im black and my hats real low
If you dont like my lyrics you can press fast forward 
Check me out..
What I write is a like a bomb device, press play
And you can die tonight
Shook ones dont exist whenever that K. Dot spit
Off the chain like fast pedaling while riding a bike
I gets my ride on, you ride too
But like Scion, now thats a damn shame
Im hogging up both lanes
Play your part, styles like Kevin Hart
Theyre so plain
Im choking while Im smoking on this strongest hocus pocus
Chocking with Punch
He sarcastic laughing cause I said that I can freestyle better than Kurupt
Now thats a statement that hopefully I can back up
See Kurupt is a legend, thats where I get my shit from
Straight lab rat, spit it once run it back
Like a punt return, they tell me wait my turn
So thats what Imma do, lay in the cut like a 2 shot Dillinger
Killing these niggas in high pursuit waddup
I got so many theories and suspicions
Im diagnosed with real people conditions
Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close, get money, and fuck bitches
I double park the Aston in the red
My momma told me that Ima work myself to death
My girl told me dont let these hoes get in your head
My world been ecstatic, I checked the signal that read
Buzzin, radars is buzzin
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, mmm
If I gotta slap a pussy ass, Ima make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, Ima make it look sexy
Like pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They wont take me out my element
No, take me out my element
Interviews wanna know my thoughts and opinions
Fox News wanna use my name for percentage
My latest muse is my niece, she worth living
See me on the TV and scream: Thats Uncle Kendrick!
But its money to get, bitches to hit 
Zeroes to flip, temptation is 
First on my list, I cant resist 
Everyone together now, know that we forever
Buzzin, radars is buzzin
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, mmm
If I gotta slap a pussy ass, Ima make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, Ima make it look sexy
Like pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They wont take me out my element
No, take me out my element
Im going to make it look
Ima make it look sexy, mmm
And they wont take me out my element
Who can I make that them better right now?
Who, oh I know thatll make it better right now?

Tell me who will never related, I
Annie, are you okay? Ooh, yeah 
Annie, are you okay? Ooh, yeah
Do you like foreplay? Ooh, yeah
Do you go both ways? I really need confirmation
Your love is abomination, fucking you is like a bomb of nations
Area 51 in that pussy, ah
The president bout to cum in that pussy, ah
I got mind control, I got dick control
I reel em in for the fishing pole
I love legs like Robyn Fenty
Stretch them shits like limo Bentleys
Catch them tits with an open mouth
The interview up outta that Oprah house
You know I love it when its pokin out
You know Im thuggin even in the drought, you know him
I fuck around and crash a brand new Bugatti
In the mothafuckin lobby so you know Im in the building
Wont you kiss it, baby? Take a picture
I, I, I, I, Im killin em
Illuminati want my money and my body
Even Donny rollin by me, looking aggravated that I made it
Fuck you and your mama, nigga
I, I, I, I, I see the bitch in them, I got the Benjamin
I got the dividend, Im on my toes like Serena at the Wimbledon
Pie à la mode on a Monday for my woman-friend
Im in the mode of a mortal man
Im living in the orbit of deliverin
Sex in a cathedral, empty, Grand Marnier that I reload, ten Gs
In the hallway, she a Leo, Im a Gemini
Give me mine, genocide, kill em all, thirty times
Who can I make that them better right now?
Who, oh I know thatll make it better right now?
Who do I know thatll make em better right now?
Who do you know?
I just wanna feel liberated I, I, I
I just wanna feel liberated I, I, I

Back it up, back it up, oh oh
Back it up, back it up, oh oh
Back it up, back it up, oh oh
Back it up, yeah
Reporting live, from Compton, California
North Cackalack
Now everybody just bow to the greatness, or die in the matrix
Youre hereby dating, my destinys waiting
My itinerary is very hectic
I break records on every record, Im truly reckless
Kendrick Lamar, no Audemar on my wrist
Its arthritis from holding it down bitch
Me and my down bitch, get busy
Im busy taking over, the world
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
My drive is not to be chauffeured
Im live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist
Whose lyrics out of the orbit, more than the hardest rapper
To hit the market and market myself as a shooting target
With offers that got me up in these offices often
Boo-yaa, who ya? No one, Ive done situated myself, I aint lying
Be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times
The good kid from the mad city
Holding a cereal box instead of a Glock
In a 1992 Cadillac that I got from my pops
Transmission slipping, but I aint tripping, swallow my pride
Pop in my tape and roll the window, down
Like Stacie homie when airing out endo
I wish a nigga would
A yes yes yall, and you dont stop
A yes yes yall, and you dont stop
A yes yes yall, and you dont stop
Kendrick, show these muhfuckers how we rock
A yes yes yall, and you dont stop
A yes yes yall, and you dont stop
A yes yes yall, and you dont stop
Big Pooh, show these muhfuckers how we rock
Yo, its evident, Im evidently your favorite
All I ask, open your ears and please savor it
The taste is un-acquired, quietly, been inspired
Im at a point in my life when I was getting tired
Now Im brushing off the dust
We dont need no water, fire burned it to the dust
Nigga grind hard, roaches turning into musk
People hear his pain, I consider that a plus
Im a grown man, so a few I have trust to Do the Right Thing
The Spike thing, consider me the in-between
The new regime taking over
Either we each others opposition or you soldier
Used to have the whole state of NC on my shoulder then I passed it
Off to the next, you unlucky bastard
Im getting drunk same time every year
To celebrate the life, Rosie no longer here
I swear
A yes yes yall, and you dont stop
A yes yes yall, and you dont stop
A yes yes yall, and you dont stop
Kendrick, show these muhfuckers how we rock
A yes yes yall, and you dont stop
A yes yes yall, and you dont stop
A yes yes yall, and you dont stop
Big Pooh, show these muhfuckers how we rock
Me and Big Pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo
Even Zeus can get beat up from punchlines
When I kick it and pump mine, Ive got to be a prophet
Ive gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet
Im a Hub City representer, so Ive got to represent the
City like a District Attorney beatin the case for killers
Might walk around in gurney, this is my sickest winter
Since I had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers
U-P-S, I deliver
Little brown boy get the pick of the litter
No glitter, all guts, no glory
Station on repeat, they retread the same story
New niggas bore me, tryna progress to that old shit
Have a plate, that food for your soul tip
Drill it in your head, youngun its that real Hip-
Hop along fore you get your little ass whipped
A yes yes yall, and you dont stop
A yes yes yall, and you dont stop
A yes yes yall, and you dont stop
Kendrick, show these muhfuckers how we rock
A yes yes yall, and you dont stop
A yes yes yall, and you dont stop
A yes yes yall, and you dont stop
Big Pooh, show these muhfuckers how we rock
Starin’ at Marilyn Monroe’s silhouette
While smokin’ my first cigarette
Listenin’ to Marvin ask his father about his death
How you shoot a nigga out, then shoot a nigga out?
Dead bodies in my dreams, Bob Marley on my couch
Pass me the blunt, he was smokin’ when he died
You really think Elvis Presley committed suicide?
I don’t, it’s either kill or you be killed
Ten pints of blood per human, ain’t no refills
One thing about us humans, nigga, we kill
Turkeys, chickens, pigs, each other, fuck us, we will
Take a life, lethal injection or free will
Tookie got murdered by the pigs, fuck did he kill?
That ain’t none of my business, though
But I’m the type of motherfucker make it his business, so
Open the book and turn that page
It reads Arthur Ashe died from AIDS, no
That’s murder, nigga
Murder
Gunfire, death is so quiet, ask why, tell ‘em it’s
Murder
The sun rise then hide by grey skies, that cry sounds like
Murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Malcolm X standing on that stage
It was staged for him to see that gauge
Murder, nigga
Doctor King outside that room
Who knew that he would die that soon?
That’s murder, nigga
JFK sittin’ in that drop
He waved goodbye, then they blew off his top
It’s murder, nigga
Diddy seen Big, and Suge watched Pac
They both was ridin’ passenger when they got shot, it’s murder
Who the fuck killed Michael Jackson, his physician?
He died slow in his music, you ain’t really listen
Now his daughter gettin’ slapped by his sister
And that’s probably gon’ kill they mama
So I’m sorry Ms. Jackson, I’m sorry Ms. Houston, sissy
Might shed a tear but ain’t no sissy
‘Cause Whitney’s sill with me
And her death kinda hurt a nigga
So let’s get back to talkin’ ‘bout murder, nigga
John Lennon got shot in the back
And Paul McCartney couldn’t do shit ‘bout that
‘Cause it was murder, nigga
Listen, this ain’t about you and me
It’s about Trayvon Martin and Huey P
And how they shot down Sam Cooke
Twelve years of school and it ain’t in one damn book
Lee Harvey Oswald ‘bout to serve a sentence
From the crowd comes a revolver
That’s murder, nigga
Gaspin’ for air, niggas cling on
Tryin’ to fight the inevitable, sing on
You hear that fat lady warmin’ up?
The end came without a warning, huh?
Them niggas real with them rags on
Niggas get killed ‘bout them flags, homes
The Game told you what the play was
So it don’t matter what you say, cuz
Say Blood, these niggas livin’ what they die by
You out here playin’ while these niggas doin’ drive-bys
If murder was the case that they gave Snoop
Then how the fuck you thinking they gon’ save you?
Them niggas played you, you doin’ stand up
You a comedian there, boy, put your hands up
Don’t turn this to a 1-8-7
I have you leanin’ on the stairway to Heaven
Spittin’ blood, these are tales from the hood
Suicide sound quicker, but a murder sounds good
Wish a motherfucker would try to play me like a toy
You get a bullet in your motherfuckin’ head, homeboy
The people sayin’ that a drug overdose killed Hendrix
They bullshitted, it was murder
Or a plane crash killed Otis Redding
That’s how they said it, but it was murder
The cops kill us at alarming rates
They point they guns at the ones they hate 
If Bin Laden brought the World Trade down
Then how the fuck did he die just now?
Murder, murder 
(Nigga, murder, murder, murder
Alls my life I has to fight, hittas
Alls my life I...
Hard times like, Yeah!
Bad trips like, Yeah!
Nazareth, Im on one

But homicide be lookin at you from the face down

Schemin, and let me tell you bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty uh, uh is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows
20 of em in my Chevy, tell em all to come and get me
Everything I sow, so my karma come
And heaven no preliminary hearing, so my record
Tell the world I know its too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Wont you please believe when I say?

Lookin at the world like, Where do we go?
Hitta, and we hate po-po

Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon be alright
We gon be alright
Huh? We gon be alright

Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon be alright
What you want, you a house, you a car?
A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, Im your dog
Look, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know its illegal
I dont think about it, I deposit every little zero
Thinkin of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Diggin in my pocket, aint a profit big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... ah!
I dont talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, heaven, I can reach you
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, thats all
Pick back and chat, I trap the back for yall
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
I right my wrongs; I write til Im right with God
Wouldnt you know
We been hurt, been down before
Hitta, when our pride was low
Lookin at the world like, Where do we go?
Hitta, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho

Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon be alright
We gon be alright
Huh? We gon be alright
We gon be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon be alright
Get back
Look I started from the bottom, at the very bottom
Mixin Hen with similac my momma knew I had a problem
I was jibbing for a bottom, putting quarter pieces in the black caprice and make it holla 
No releasing me, I got the piece in me, I gotta
Keep the decency and make them TNT my product
Im a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator, energizer
Inner-city bullet fly til that thing on auto pilot 
I dont really care about the care abouts
All I care about is wearing out your upper body
When I catch ya, when I catch ya, walking out your parents house
Fourteen years old sound so raw making plays home boy
Big Ks and my big dogs
Never, ever, went straight home, boy
Yeah, see, I know I can make a lot of money doing this, man
Its just the whole process that uh...
That Im having trouble with, you know what I mean?
I know you just, pretty much, you know
Get the water boiling, and just, uh, get a jar or something like that
Put it in the jar and just watch it you know bubble up and all that
Shame on him! 
Lemme put my gloves on
And my scrubs on
Im the chemist thats whippin it in the kitchen
This here is not for the children
You need parental advision
If you wanna learn how to cook in the dope business
First you bargain shop
Look for the priciest chickens
I recommend that you pay Jorge a visit
Got it wrapped in saran
17.5 no, drop four grand, this is LA man!
Unless it be a drought
But homie if it aint, then it is somewhere else
Flip your hustle down south
Thats a whole other story though
Back to the lesson, hope youre takin down your footnotes, class is in session
Get your instruments
Grab some baking soda, a triple beam, a beaker
And a hanger you can stir it with
Split nine Os four ways in that 36
Place it on the triple beam
As hard as it may seem, its not that tricky
Say youll get it baby, just bear with me
Confidence before compliments
Now lets get busy
This is the procedure
250 grams of coke, 150 grams of soda
Place it in the beaker
Your water should be boiling by then
Grab a small cup and pour it in
Twist the hanger until its paper thin
Place the hanger in the beaker then give your wrist a circular spin
But hold on it gets tricky again!
As your hand rotate
Youre probably thinkin its safe
Until it starts to harden, slowing down the pace
The muscle inside your arm is makin your joints ache
Youre strugglin on the job, but dont lose faith
Wait...you got it back soft 
Now pour some hot water inside the beaker jar
The work should rise to the top
Then pour some cold water on that
Thats when the dope should drop
Snatch the cookie out the jar, grab a razor from the cabinet
Place it on the cardboard, then chop
As soon as the razor hit the work, youre happy
Youre excited that the chemistry worked
This the fiends appetite
This bigger than life
You turned to Mr. Nino Brown in one night
You should thank me twice
Though you learned from a chemist who never moved a brick in his life
How ironic...hmm
Like most of you rappers
Aw I dont believe that man
Youre too professional with it man
Theres no way youve never done it before, you know what I mean?
That was too descriptive
Bitch, Im in the club
With the homies, tell me whats good
Im tryna get these hoes single
And this is my single
Okay, what these niggas hollin bout?
Catastrophic K-Dot, bet I bring them dollas out

Sipping on that hundred proof and Im dressed in Gucci too

Move somethin, move, move somethin
Got these stacks full of hundreds with an icon woman
On my left, my right, my right, my left, Im throwed
Beyonces, two Halles and three Keyshia Coles
Wait a minute , can I pop my tags? 
Can I do the fool? Can I swing my rag? 
Im a Hub City maniac, bitch, get it right
Bartender, hurry up, put them bottles on ice
Bitch, Im in the club
With the homies, tell me whats good
Im tryna get these hoes single
And this is my single
I got a hundred dollas on me 
Baby girl, I know you wanted 
All righty I might be in some loafers or Nikes
Faded blazer or white tee, either way she gon like me

Which is a lot of juice, motherfuck swag
Where you at? Bitch, Im in the club
With the homies, tell me whats good

Baby girl I know you wanted
Ali, mix it
Ha ha ha, Lady G, Whaddup?
Ha ha ha, Bad Love, Whaddup?
Ha ha ha, ha...
I spaz out til I pass out
There’s clarity in my vulgarity for a sass-mouth
Your parody’s not funny
Apparently you aint nothing but industry crash dummies
As long as the lord love me, I’m good
I could: be the best rapper but I’d rather be the answer that capture the violence that coincides in my hood
I should: stick a fork in this music business
But I’m too deep in it like pussy on my penis
Devil’s kitchen in Phoenix; that’s the heat that I’m bringing where the shade at?
I’m L.A. radio and good music, boy, I don’t play that
Ugh, Walking a thin line from thinking like Einstein
And rhyming like Rakim in ’89
Don’t wanna pack a nine just a mind full of wisdom
Like a man 99 years old locked in prison
Don’t freeload on my vision
Get exposed like an R&B ho with a sex tape hidden
I’m always for the business, forever you can feel it
Whether you Crip blue or a nigga that hemorrhage
My penmanship is like me and Langston combined to the hip
And my hip to the hop don’t stop as I rock
I got a buzz like a shot of Palmer Sun
And the women fall in love as they fall in my crotch
Now understand that I’m all that you’ve got
Give me chance, give me ears, give me hearts, give me props
Hear the difference? I’m cool like that
Oh, you spit? Well the retarded drool is back
See, I’m the author of the authors, the father of the Austin Power fajja
Who can bust like a charter, why bother?
I know a jealous serpent is a burden to my life
But still I carry on like luggage on a flight
The realness in my bones is the DNA to life
I can give you insight only if you’re in sight
I’m looking past y’all like a fastball - strike!
And I aint even tryna give it my all - yikes!
I’m comfortable enough to go and chill out with a Huxtable
You couldn’t see my pedestal, because you’re afraid of heights
Cloud 9, where you can find
Me in my dime like Roosevelt in his prime
Wait til I’m in my prime
The moon and the stars will align on my Louis V. belt like Orion
To whom say he cool: but the irony is I could hold the bottom of an iron with the bottom of my palm
I say so much, so little all action, no talk like a mime throwing up gang signs
It’s not all about punchlines, I don’t do that
I’m a Jaguar; you’re just a new cat, now move back
Kendrick Lamar on the radar for success
Aiming for the top like an AR aimed at your neck
I can never digress, ‘less I get demoted to death
Even then I’ll be the best still, like a petty theft
I will: conquer my biggest dreams
Once you open the cage, I bet that I’ll spread my wings
Nipsy got street cred, Jay Rock got street cred
And all I got is bad credit, big ears and big head
But still they’ll feel me, cause we all ate cereal
Humped our mommas friends daughter while they bump the stereo
Backflips on shopping carts, free lunch at the park
Watched Power Rangers after school; here we go
I’m so Comptonized, I will never compromise
For no faulty ass A&R or CEO
We aint what you think and you think we’re back
But we’ve been here for decades, and I vouch for that
Open your mouth for that, speak well like a great debater over iChat
Get your other eye cracked
I don’t rap, I-Iraq and declare war
I enjoy watching enemies blood pour
I came up lower middle class, not poor
So don’t feel sorry for me, I don’t need y’all to love me
I need y’all to feel me
And if you feeling froggy to leap, then feel free
My feeling’s all aside, my pride is deprived
By the ultimate prize Imma get when I see your suicide
There, there, baby
Its just textbook stuff
Its in the ABCs of growin up
There, there, baby
ItS just textbook stuff
Its in the ABCs of growin up
Three women raised me
Famous Footwear paid me not enough to blow up
But showed up cause I aint fuckin lazy
And teachers thought I was dumb or crazy, or both
With hopes of being a Nas or Jay-Z, I slumped
In my chair and my grades, my head wasnt raised
Being fly was priority to the lowest
I would stand on my desk just to see the world in a different way
The dead society of a poet—homie, Im focused
But theres somethin that a dude cant prove
I mean, fam, I was damn near invisible at school
So I banged for a minute cause all my niggas was Crippin
Just me and my two of my dudes, Blue Man Group
Had dreams of doing things they say that you cant do
Cause everything aint black and white, less you chew bamboo
So I was after big bills like a toucan do
All the while, my mom askin why Im truant at school
She said:
There, there, baby
Its just textbook stuff
Its in the ABCs of growin up
There, there, baby
ItS just textbook stuff
Its in the ABCs of growin up
Ugh, so why aint I go to college?
My mamas ultimatum, made me say that I know I got it
My niggas said Vs buggin
Stay on your computer software, debugging
But we holding hardware cause we thuggin
Now they in the traphouse with some guns that they done borrowed
And all this snow, I call it Infant Sorrow
With plans to reach the end even if I had to start slow
Sold CDs in the mall, making dough like Sbarro
Then I left the hood, like, Fuck it, dont need the cargo
They banking I dont do well, and I dont mean Fargo
But even when you leave, somehow, it still try to follow
Baby brother took a charge harder than LeBron and Rondo
Trying to keep his head up while his eyes are in the Bible
Cause they say a mind thats idle is a devils toy aisle
My nephew looking at me cause his daddy is his idol
I looked at him, told him, Sit down, this information is vital, look
There, there, baby
Its just textbook stuff
Its in the ABCs of growin up
There, there, baby
ItS just textbook stuff
Its in the ABCs of growin up
Living my life like Im living right
In the midst of a fire pit, the gangbanging and violence
Is the sweetest song, and I roam with the heart of a violin
Dont violate my patience Im waiting... to kill a man
As I stare at the ceiling fan, as a fan of these wicked streets
If I gotta eat, I steal like a metal piece
Im screamin out, Fuck the police
Im dealing my cards with Jokers on em
You can disown him or stone him
Im throwing them rocks back with the fury of bullets
You couldnt live your life for the moment
When Im foaming at the mouth and my sharpest of teeth showing
Im in the back of a black Buick finna black out, like February—
Aint thats how Blacks do it, right?
I cut off my ears before I hear your advice and vice versa
Im screaming for help as loud as I can, but thats not working
Im working them corners like blueprints
Then caught a L on my first offense
The judge threw the book at me and said this:
There, there, baby
Its just textbook stuff
Its in the ABCs of growin up
There, there, baby
ItS just textbook stuff
Its in the ABCs of growin up
I am a sinner who’s probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don’t know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that’s amazing
To you that’s a quick check with all disrespect let me say this
Im trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
Youre trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And Im looking right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, Ill let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
Imma break out and then hide every lock
Imma break out and then hide every lock
 + 
I am a human who’s probably gonna fault again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Dont approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Pulling up and hopping out
Shell, catch it poppin out
And I aint never been a Tom or a Jerry
Pussy or a Rat, pussy on my nutsack
Carry plenty Kenny tats, give me that, give me plenty fetti
Federales on my back, pack them in the cemetery
Send a scary hit out on your messenger
Im ignorant to wrestle a gorilla in the center of an Acura Integra
Im pissed off, so I piss off rooftops
Drinking through a straw, fuck a rent-a-cop
Im hot, Im napalm when the beat slap like eight palms
And I wear eight charms, every airport alarm
Go off till they tackle me, what I do wrong?
Nigga it aint bout the chain, nigga you the fucking bomb
Bomb on a bitch nigga then his bitch later
Put the tips on the bitch, nigga you a fucking waiter
I dont even want a favor, I just want a fair one
And its like that till the sheriffs come
Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Dont approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Droop-E, look
Problems we solve them, bout that action
One less sucker nigga, thats subtraction
His boss is, factors on the team
Real niggas, no actors on the team
Not you, who Droop? He a good dude
Put him in a bad mood, he turn you into goon food
Im in the party, feeling like me
S-I-C-K with TDE
Your bitch want sex and my ear like wax
And this Landy got her ready to get it hit from the back
She shows up chump, salute give daps
Get your face flat, you dont want that
Get your nose tapped, you dont want that
Get your life fucked up all over a batch
Get cropped, get chopped on your head like a barber shop
Have it out in the parking lot
Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Dont approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Stay turned, super charged up, stoned
Ghetto pass never revoked
Mouthpiece faster than a speedboat
Keep it one hundred like a C-note, pea coat
Po-po tryna decode lingo
Not drunk but Im finna be hella twisted
Lifted like a toilet seat, grown ass kid
My bitch always telling me, I aint shit
She hate me, but she love my dick
Trapper factor macker having money like a rapper
Bumping local talent pulling up with the blabber
Patna wanna challenge cause my pockets hella fatter
But he gone be unlucky like walking under a ladder
Put hands on a man, fuck unity
Aint nothing between us, but space and opportunity
Never been a sucker, never been a lame
Stay in your lane, you cant see me like a stealth plane
Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Dont approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Where you from Droop-E? 
Where you from Kendrick? 
Aye 40 where you from though? 
Who bring it to their front door? 
And where they get their game from? 
And where they get their slang from? 
And where they get their strains from? 
And where they get their grapes from?
Pardon my Bohemian ways
I know I act like I be stuck in a Bohemian daze
You said you love me, so dont rush me
Love is patient and now you gotta trust me
To take form, like the canvas of the Grand Canyon
Product of a beautiful storm or an unborn
Carried just below the heart
Quietly preparing for his start
Let me Michelangelo my Sistine Chapel
You know they say Rome wasnt built in a day
And diamonds need a while before they hit the display
So I guess I see myself in a similar way
Im paced, like my momma in the kitchen whipping
Always mixing up and fixing
Begged her for a taste and she said it wasnt ready
She stir it up slow and she cook it up steady
This is not a race track, living in the ASAP
Im just trying to do it justice when it play back
Sometimes I gotta stall the BPM
So I can weave these dreams and polish up these gems
In the end, I got love for the show biz
But sometimes you gotta stop and smell the roses
Keeping up with the Kardashians and Joneses
Nah, I take my time and compose this
They say greatness get better with time
They say concrete roses hard to find
Sit inside my room, and let these thoughts bloom
Its a secret garden in my mind
Flower child
Okay, buffering, creativity suffering
When you bustlin hustlin for the numbers and
You missed the journey if you climbed too fast
The beauty of the struggle when it comes to pass
Amateurs swear they need a balancer
I want that legendary like excalibur
Chasing calibers liberated as a bachelor
Traveler, never falling victim to these calendars
Rough draft after rough draft
No staff, perfecting on my abstract craft
And now they calling me celebrity
Only thing I give a damn about is my integrity
They play the game like checkers when Im talking bout chess
Tryna do more when Im talking bout less, I stress
Quantity aint always quality
So let me formulate my prophecy
When the lights get low and you notice I am the sun
The winter time was snow but only little you know
I will still breathe, give me the keys
Im resuscitating the game, see me in CPR
My name is a gun cocked, gun shot
Dead and I wont stop
Gun cocked, gun shot
Head in a pine box
With a dozen roses, hold this with a gift card
Gun cocked, gun shot
Flowers on your mommas yard
They say greatness get better with time
They say concrete roses hard to find
Sit inside my room, and let these thoughts bloom
Its a secret garden in my mind
Flower child
They say greatness gets better with time
So why expedite my prime?
See Im just a lilac tied to the earth
Exuding the fragrance of light and birth
So respect my photosynthesis
My petals, my stems, full of nourishing flow
You thought this was a love song, but no
I just need you to let me grow
Its alive, its moving
Its alive, oh its alive
Its alive, its alive
Its alive in the name of god
Now I know what it feels like to be god
Im not a newcomer, Im a new wonder elite
K-Dizzle
I rap with a Pyrex in the projects
Im crack in a pot, Im a prospect
Im a pirate on a dock full of dope
I can dissect any rapper
You could vote for the Lochness
You cannot test no key in the Tesla
Bitch I ride like a freight train parked outside
And my young niggas came with the extras
Its alive

Every member of raps Mount Rushmore dropped new albums in 2013—Kanye, Jay Z, Drake, Eminem—but it was another MC altogether who stole the crown, and he did it with just a handful of verses: Kendrick Lamar, the latest—and possibly greatest—rapper to come straight outta Compton.
We are 10,000 feet above Compton in a private jet, and Kendrick Lamar is explaining to me what happened to him yesterday, when he vanished. We had a plan: Kendrick was going to give me a guided, cue-the-G-funk-synth Star Maps tour of his neighborhood, the one he still more or less lives in, starting at his parents house a couple of blocks from his old high school, Centennial High, near the corner of Piru and South Central. Instead, he went AWOL. The whole day, no one from his label, Interscope, or Top Dawg Entertainment, the baby Death Row Records that originally signed him, could track him down. Kendrick was gone.
It turned out he was sitting shivah for a murdered friend he calls his little bro—a kid from a neighborhood where friendship is defined primarily by neighborhood. A few weeks earlier, Chad Keaton, 23, had been wounded in a drive-by shooting very close to Kendricks parents house. He held on for a month but ultimately died of complications from the gunshot wounds.
So today, here on board this Challenger 300 seven-seater, en route to New York Citys fall Fashion Week, a destination filled with people Kendrick isnt sure whether he wants to impress or fuck with, hes telling me about Chad. It all happened when I was overseas, he says. I had to talk to him over Skype on the hospital bed before he passed.
Its been a strange year. When it began, Kendrick was already regarded as something of a messiah among rap nerds—one of the best rappers ever to come out of the place that has produced many of the best rappers ever—and since then his legend has spread fast.
It actually began late last year, when Kendricks major-label-debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d city,dropped, to universal acclaim. The album—about a day in the life of nerdy Compton teenager K.Dot and his homeys as they run around in his moms minivan chasing that crazy-ass girl Sherane—is practically a black Ulysses: a portrait of the rapper as a young man, simultaneously a drive-by deconstruction of gangster raps violent tropes and a celebration of its signature, slow-rolling sound. On good kid, Lamar is our embedded correspondent, spitting triple-time confessionals from a part of the country most of us had forgotten once the rap scene found a fresher inner city to fetishize. Hes the games most linguistically cerebral MC, but also its realest—the one who finds the most vivid way to tell a story about his unemployed buddies trying to rope him into robbing some dudes house—and its this polarity that makes listening to King Kendrick feel like youre putting on the illest 3-D glasses in hip-hop. The music nods at influences far beyond the West Coast—Beach House samples, Dungeon Family lushness—but throughout, his voice stays singularly focused on a twenty-block radius around Central Avenue and Piru Street:If Pirus and Crips all got along Theyd probably gun me down by the end of this songGood kid, m.A.A.d city sold an industry-shocking 241,000 copies its first week and went platinum this summer. Then, in August, Kendrick snuck a sixty-four-bar Trojan horse into his buddy Big Seans song Control—a guest spot on a song that didnt even make the final record. After Big Sean goes on for a while about drinking champagne in Detroit, Kendrick wakes up the entire hip-hop universe, calling out nearly every single young rapper in the game: Drake; A$AP Rocky; J. Cole; Tyler, the Creator; even Big Sean himself. The dude slaps Sean on his own song. He also proclaimed himself the king of New York, which to certain East Coast ears sounded like a Greek dude strolling into Troy and dropping a deuce on the tomb of Hector.
Control leaked on YouTube late in the day on August 12; for a solid week, it was the biggest story in music. Just a few weeks after that, Kanye announced he was touring solo for the first time in five years and that his opening act would be Kendrick Lamar.
Kendricks career momentum has created a dissonance that must look surreal from 30,000 feet. Chad Keatons memorial service was held just before Labor Day weekend; Kendrick attended, then flew straight to a show in Alaska. Next it was on to Vegas to perform at a pool party. He only made it back to the set to grieve for a single day, the day we were scheduled to talk. It can be complicated and confusing, Kendrick says of his life right now, funerals for murdered friends one day, private jets to fashion parties the next. From my perspective, its not just Im famous—I still live in this world. And when someone back home needs something, I still gotta get that phone call.
Its clear the emotions are still raw. Kendrick is a small guy, just five feet six, and with his black hood pulled up over his head, a chain around the outside of his sweatshirt, it felt like I was talking to a wizened rap Jedi. After about an hour of questions, I gave him a break, and he lay down on the couch to rest. Just kind of curled up with his back turned.
A bit later, I saw a tweet from him to his 2.4 million followers pop up on my phone: When the cameras stop rolling, it doesnt mean real life will follow. Instantly it had fifty-six retweets. After one minute, 600. After two minutes, 1,000. Then he tweeted a picture of Chad: Rest N Heaven my Lil bro. Watched u become a man. U fought bro. The city stole yo life, but not your legacy.
On the night of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, just as the heat over Control was peaking, I tailed Kendrick through the backstage maze at Brooklyns Barclays Center. At one point, he ran into Drake, and they wrapped each other up in a big hug. It was their first encounter since Kendrick called him out on Control, and of all the slaps in that verse, this one felt the most personal, because Drake had helped break Kendrick, handing the kid not just a verse but an entire song on his second album. After Drakes VMA performance of Hold On, Were Going Home, Kendrick made his way back to the greenroom, crooning the hook: I got my eyes on you.... He caught mine and smiled. You watch, he joked, Im going to be singing by my fifth album!
I asked if this meant things were cool between him and Drake. He paused. Pretty cool. Shrugs. And I mean, I would be okay if we werent.
A month later, it became apparent that things between Kendrick and Drake were definitely not cool. After Drakes new album dropped, he gave a pair of interviews in which he sounded wounded by the Control thing: You cant just say that and then see me and be like, Yeah, man, whats up?—pretending like nothing ever happened. Seemingly in response, during the BET Hip-Hop Awards cypher a few weeks later, Kendrick freestyled: Nothing been the same since they dropped Control / and tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes.
I got Kendrick on the phone after the BET taping, and he admitted to being surprised by Drizzys public lash-out—Control named names, sure, but at its core it was a backhanded tribute to the peers Kendrick actually gives a shit about. Most of them took it in that spirit. Not Drake. Yeah, I guess he took it as a dis, Kendrick said, downplaying talk of a beef. But he was also clear that he doesnt look up to Drake, doesnt see him as any kind of creative influence. When I asked if Drake was a mentor or a role model, he replied quickly, No—peer. If anything. We all peers.
When Kendrick Lamar was 21, 2Pac appeared to him in a vision. Before you roll your eyes, Lamar wants you to know that hes not the hermit-on-the-edge-of-the-Nitrian-Desert, vision-seeing type. He knows how this sounds.
I was coming from a late studio session, sleeping on Moms couch. Im 26 now—it wasnt that long ago. I remember being tired, tripping from the studio, lying down, and falling into a deep sleep and seeing a vision of Pac talking to me. Weirdest shit ever. Im not huge on superstition and all that shit. Thats what made it so crazy. It can make you go nuts. Hearing somebody that you looked up to for years saying, Dont let the music die. Hearing it clear as day. Clear as day. Like hes right there. Just a silhouette.
The visit from Pac changed Kendricks connection to the world he was chronicling in his music and compelled him to think more carefully about who was listening to it. It wasnt just about money, hoes, clothes, drinkin, he explains. I mean, I come from that world, but at the same time, I started to realize that theres people out there that cant really connect to that lifestyle. Theyre in the struggle.
Much of Kendricks music now is an attempt to transcend his ravaged world without separating himself from it in judgment, about somehow gaining control over his households chaos—some of his uncles were Crips, and his father was reportedly a Gangster Disciple in Chicago before moving to Compton—and over his neighborhoods warped commitment to adolescent pride. Its an ethos that extends to his crew. They have a seriousness of purpose, a rigorous discipline that can feel slightly monastic at times. Kendrick doesnt smoke weed or drink booze. In the time I spent with him, I never witnessed anyone roll even the thinnest spider leg of a jay, nor did I see Kendrick so much as glance at the many, many girls around him. When I ask OGs why theres so much division in the streets—nobody never really knows, he says. But you know one thing that everybody always mention? A woman.
A few hours after the VMAs, we were back in Kendricks hotel room and everybody was in a lull, staring at cell phones, waiting for news about afterparties. A plan coalesced to hit a party being thrown by Diddy at the Dream Downtown hotel. But one of Kendricks Top Dawg boys leaned back and said, Aw, man, I cant go to no club.
Kendrick spoke up.
We have to go.
Look at you! We have to go. Youre never we have to go.
You know me, Kendrick explained. I only go when theres a point. Usually the point is just niggas drinking. But walking through the club the week after I released the Control verse? Thats a point!
Twenty minutes later, Anthony Top Dawg Tiffith, basically TDEs Suge Knight, asked if I had had a fun day. I said that I had and that I was surprised by their discipline. You guys seem so calm, I said.
Well, Tiffith told me, were going to have to call it a night with you, because we about to get uncalm. You understand.The gossip from Diddys Ciroc Amaretto Launch Party/VMA Afterparty sounded like it fell out of a massive tear in the mid-90s West Coast-East Coast time wave. Bloggers breathlessly recounted a surreal scene at Dream: booths packed with hip-hop illuminati—Jay, Bey—mouths agape as a wasted Diddy, incensed by the King of New York boast, attempted to pour a drink over Kendricks head, only to be thwarted by Jay Z acolyte J. Cole, who was kicked out in the ensuing chaos. Naturally Kendrick himself refused to corroborate any of this. It was all love at that party, he told me on the private jet.
After we land at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, I catch a ride with Kendrick into Manhattan. His show tonight is a New York Fashion Week kickoff party in Chelsea thrown by industry doyenne Jenné Lombardo, and in the car he goofs around, imagining the horror he and his Compton homeys could inspire: We invited Kendrick Lamar, not K.Dot and them Piru niggas.
By the end of his forty-minute set, the crowd is pretty fucked-up. Theres chronic in the air; models are tottering in their heels. When Kendrick launches into the call-and-response for Swimming Pools , a song about his familys dark relationship with chemical dependency—Head shot. DRANK. Sit down. DRANK. Stand up. DRANK—a wraithlike six-foot blonde with a white veil dances around a little coven of models. There is something demonic about the scene: Kendrick recounting his fever dreams about the grim consequences of decadence while presiding over a decadent Fashion Week party.
Its hard to guess how scenes like this will change Kendrick and his music. Sometime in January, he will step into Top Dawgs booth again, and he expects to be just as surprised as the rest of us by what comes out. I dont know, he says. It depends on where my emotion is. How angry Ill be, or how happy Ill be, or how confused Ill be.
At one point on good kid Kendrick raps, I can feel the changes / I can feel a new life / I always knew life can be dangerous. The biggest change in Kendricks life is the inversion of raps consummate observer becoming the observed. How will all eyez on him affect his art? Because hes already 10,000 feet above Compton, and rising.
I guess you could say, Its not easy
I guess you could say, You live and learn
I want yall to all em, I paid my dues
And when its all said and done, I did it my way

Yesterday my nigga had told me his brother died
A day before that his homeless uncle was cold outside
A week before he seen the cancer in his mothers eyes
Two weeks before that, couldnt pay his rent cause he lost his job
A month before that he lost the custody of his daughter
Six months before that her mother said she wont see her father
And this before he did a year when them charges brought up
I shook my head, turned around then found a $100
I dont know why You keep blessing me
I dont know why You keep blessing me
I dont know why You keep blessing me
I dont know why You keep blessing me
I dont know why, I dont know why, I dont know why
Yesterday I invaded privacy of a home
The day before that my partner had fronted me a zone
A week before I had loaded bullets inside that chrome
Two weeks before that I shot them bullets and he was gone
A month before that I cursed my mother then slammed the door
Six months before that I hit my woman, she hit the floor
I stormed out then seen a black Honda Accord
Them hollow tips missed me then hit that little boy
So today I laid in my bed, stared at the ceiling
Closed my eyes then asked myself how I was feeling
I analyzed on how a saint can play the villain
Is my life coincidental or just God willing
I came to grips, jumped up, and looked out the window
See my nigga had that same little boy that didnt know
Bullets is nameless, I guess this is meant for
Me to give them a $100 then trash my pistol
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why, now I know why, now I know why
So I can bless you
So I can bless you
So I can bless you
Lord help me
Cause I need You
I know this weed is burning
And Im on drink number two
But its all to soothe the pain from this
Cold, cold world
Sometimes I think You can help me
But this bus here is temporary
So Im talking to You
This sick world will drive a sane man crazy
Birds dropping out the sky, daughters having their fathers babies
And this the news I hear
When my god kids, nieces, and nephews turn a year
I wonder, will it get better
A little cheddar, when will it get better
But the risk of thats cash will
Make last years Christmas gift be, my last
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow, but somehow, but somehow
If I just keep the faith
I know Youll be right there
Sometimes it may not seem that You are there
But Youre there
I feel Youre there
Youre everywhere
And I thank You for
Protecting me in these streets
From danger seen and unseen
I never know
What happened the night
I wasnt there
Something told me leave so I left
It was the next morning
Three got shot after the club
All listening to that small voice
Oh you saved my life
Yo, this ya man Wiz Khalifa, yo LA Leakers, where the fuck did y’all find this one?
I had that one zipped up with the good shit
Everyday I try to escape the realities of this world
So I tell a disc jockey “press play” while I press up on a girl
In the midst of the smoke in the air
The reflection of lights that glare
She’ll be out of control like a hydroplane in plain sight I might have to stare
And that’s power steering, a power trip will see my appearance
Pile of hundreds all on a prowl like vampires in the darkest dungeon
Speakers bumpin’, drinks is pouring
We in the house, we paid the mortgage, tyrannosaurus
That’s real big, pop my collar, pop that lid
Flashin’ lights, model types, vixen show me much love
Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to
Fire burning, heads is turning, all I see is energy
So eventually we’ll do this til the sun come up 
We’ll do this til the sun come up 
Smoke like this til the sun come up 
We’ll do this til the moon is dropping day break watching
Then do it again
Some people stay home and sleep, me I go out at night
All seven days of the week, I live the party life
I got my dogs with me, you can bring some of your friends
We going hard til the sun come up and do it again
I got a drink in my hand they playing my favorite song
This girl that’s dancing on me aint got no panties on
And she gonna come back to my hotel, don’t tell
Anyone about us, I’m here to party all night
Flashin’ lights, model types, vixen show me much love
Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to
Fire burning, heads is turning, all I see is energy
So eventually we’ll do this til the sun come up 
We’ll do this til the sun come up 
Smoke like this til the sun come up 
We’ll do this til the moon is dropping day break watching
Then do it again
Come to my section 
And down some of this liquor
Then tell me what it hit for
Gon be some things I don’t remember
So take some camera phone pictures
Come to my section 
And down some of this liquor

Hol up, hol up, hol up, hol up
Where the fuck did yall get this record from, homie?
Have you ever ever ever been depressed so bad
It was a struggle every day not to regret your past
Feeling cursed like you never ever get your swag
And you was speeding down the highway when your threshold pass
When you cried all your tears out
And one page of your diary can tell you what your year ’bout
That’s a lonely place
My mama said “Son, why such a lonely face?”
Because the pressure’s on me
Plus I feel like Bill Murray trapped in Punxsutawney
Dr. Phil told me that I can sell crack or hit the army
Look at where we live at
Tell me you don’t hear that
Tell me you don’t feel that
Show me to the way out
Tell me when pastor Raphael gon’ reveal that
If not, man I’m outta here
I’m just a sleep walking robot that’s outta gear
I stick my nose out the water to the sky for air
Lama sabachthani
I’m trying to see light but the devil trying to blind me
The grim reaper walking with his shovel right behind me
Trying to introduce me to the untimely unkindly
I Walk the line finely like Johnny Cash
But I keep getting visits from the ghost of the past
So I spark another L then I go to the pad
Yeah I can reconcile being depressed real bad
I’m a thinker not a drinker but still I hennessy drag
Alcohol numbs the pain like with novacane stabs
In your arteries pardon me but my city go mad
Via Compton California, corners with coroners and karma on em
Colors corresponding to gangs upon us
Common corrupted crip & piru’s cripple the city
Triple the crime, Bible nor the Qur’an can save
Welcome don’t be afraid, your city similar right?
Where the choppers kidnap the night and police silence your rights
Stare at the sky wonder will you live to see 25?
I’m 22 at 20 I knew I was against the odds
This kid named Jonathan was monitorin’
His momma & sister, his older cousin he honoured him
Anonymous bodies on his burner was astonishin’
To Johnny he might have been a modern day rider then
He walking outside again, he see the lifestyle of an active member
Pull out a mac 11, now his eyes is big
Fascinated by mayhem, what’s his cousin to say now?
He wanna be from the hood that he’s from and thats one
More gangster under the family tree, took em under his wings like KFC
Crip crazy, rocking matching t-shirts that says “the hood made me”
No love just spread slugs thats the policy, the leader and the prodigy
Now shorty do-wap, holdin a ou-wap, hanging with rah rah’s with blah blah’s
That sit on the block catching fades, hitting licks, going on missions with lunatics
A 9th grade menace thugging for 6 months, smoking like 6 blunts
An hour the power of banging, he was walking… 3 Gun Shots
Little Johnny
I think you’ll find, sir, that there will come a time
When black people wake up and become intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
As other humans are intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
Then the black man will think like a black man and he will feel for other black people
And this new thinking and feeling will cause black people to stick together
And then at that point you’ll have a situation
Where when you attack one black man, you are attacking all black men
And this type of black thinking will cause all black people to stick together
And this type of thinking also will bring an end
To the brutality inflicted upon black people by 
And it is the only thing that will bring an end to it
No federal court, state court or city court will bring an end to it
It’s something that the black man has to bring an end to
Sail
Sail
This is how I show my love
I made it in my mind because
I blame it on my A.D.D. baby
This is how an angel cries
I blame it on my own sick pride
Blame it on my A.D.D. baby
Sail, sail, sail, sail, sail, sail, sail, sail
Uh huh, Kendrick Lamar 
I look in the mirror and nothings familiar I stare
I look in the mirror and nothings familiar I dare
For you to say that youre familiar with character which this I have
Mental is riding a big yellow cab
Telling the driver to press on the gas
Yell at them until I get there
You could just love me and leave me alone
Im warning you though if you love me you never go wrong
We can explore heavy feelings of breathing mother natures air
Feelings of knowing Im rather rare
But theres a reason for all of my madness the gladness I am that youre here
Sail, sail, sail, sail, sail
This is how I show my love
Let my soul sail before Im washed up
Gotta drop down thank God above that Im high enough to give the sky a touch 
Maybe its my A.D.D. Im on the move like a real estate agency
Century 21, 21st Century bare the birth of my history there can only be one 
This how I show my love
Let my soul sail like Miss Aiko
Sacrifice my life just to free the people the Jesus sequel 
So many admire us cause they cant see through our iriss
I got an eye for her, I got an eye for her, I got three eyes
I need three brides
Sail, sail, sail, sail, sail
La la la la la la oh!
La la la la la la oh!
Sail, sail, sail, sail

His eyes bloodshot red
I watched him as he took a fifth of Henny to the head in memory of his brother
Reminiscin on them playing Sega with each other
He was hurtin, I could see it, plenty tears, no Kleenex
I stood by his side because that was my homie
Gave him a hug, some of his brothers blood got on me
Clinchin his fist on some angry shit
Stood up, sat back down on the curb and asked me who they be hangin with
I wasnt sure, so I gave him no answer
But I was sure that he had him a blammer and wanted war
Revenge, what do you say to a good friend
That just lost it and grabbin choppers out of the closet?
I tried my best to make him re-neg
But he was like, My nig, this feelin is more than personal
I stood down
He hopped in a four-door Honda Accord
Before he bent the block, he said, K-Dot...
...You wouldnt understand
(These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
Or, at least, try to understand
(The city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s
The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh woe)
Corners become monuments for the dead
Candles on the pavement, postcard read
Rest in peace, the yellow tape blockin off the streets
A baby mama yellin at the police
But you dont understand
You figure that were just a bunch of niggas but the picture heres a story untold
See, this wasnt in our plans
Babies from the late 80s wasnt born crazy, we was raised that way
Put that Malcom X book down, then raise that K
Complete chaos when we off X pills and St. Ides
Look the devil in the face, from a sane eye
Cast the spell on you like Akeelah and the Bee
Every killer in the street is a teen with a corrupted mind
Substance, time, is no longer an issue
We dont have it, so pass the tissue
Then close the casket, kiss the momma when you can
And tell her you understand, but you dont understand
(These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
And, hopefully, youll understand
(The city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s
The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh woe)
He came back fifteen minutes later
He said, Dot, I went on one, do me this favor
Dump these guns in a safe place, let nobody see you
This as critical as it gets, my nigga, I need you
I said, Alright, so what happened?
Seen a few niggas slippin and I just started clappin
I didnt care who I was hittin
Thats wild shit, but anyway, I got you
I love you nigga make sure you hit me up by tomorrow
I woke up the next mornin with a cold
Allergies got me sneezin and wipin my nose when it was leaking
Checked the medicine cabinet, lookin for some DayQuil
But all I seen was some Aspirin, sjust my luck
I got up, went to Rite-Aid
Hopin that the pharmacy department had the right aid
I bought it and left
Walked to the parking lot, thats when I seen the faces of death
Said they was lookin for my man, with a chopper in they hand
Prayin it would jam, but you dont understand
(These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
Im tellin you, do you understand?
(The city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s)
Huh? Do you understand?
(The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh woe)
Its like
Its a revolving door
That Ive been a part of
My whole life
Fucked up, right?
Better off without you
Better off my baby
Better off without
Better off my baby
And Im better off without you
Better off my baby
Better off my baby
Better off without you
I waited for you mainly
Cant believe you made me
Oh lord of daydreams
Leading on the maybes
And why you would treasure me
Search for you and rule me
Close sits on nothing
Why we should be killing
Sorrow, sorrow 
Crossed hearts 
Im better without you, yeah
Im better without you, yeah
Every
Is only half full in your thoughts
You get no better now
Patiently, cause youre so heavy in my heart
I could do better now
Im with you
Im with you 
And you want me
I can choose my own 
I know I can do better
Love is life and life is love, I like to love
Every part of you, the party life can never do enough
So many obstacles the possibilities are breaking up
Can move in hospital with that extra patient you got me stuck
Ill play the prostitute if youve got the patience to pimp me
But you never put me on the strip, put it on then you strip
Put it on your fingertips and Ill kiss it off
You better not kiss me goodbye, Test my faith and kiss the cross
Im trying to go there, take you slow there if its alright
Tell me that you care, baby, we could share a full life
Truth and double dare that I do repair broken hearts
Cupid shot me in the dark, stupid I didnt play my part
Ask for your forgiveness, if its worth it I can serve a purpose
If Im st.. st.. stuttering because Im nervous
Tell me that you love me still, promise that Im staying still
Honesty is all I need, honestly, we can build
The stakes are full now
Still, wait for you
Im better off with you , yeah
Im better off with you, yeah
Every
Is only half full in your thoughts
You get no better now
Patiently, cause youre so heavy in my heart
I could do better now
Im with you
Im with you 
And you want me
I can choose my own 
I know I can do better
Im with you 
I cant choose life 
I could do better, better now
Real rap, I knock rhymes right off of your skull cap
You cant see me when I step into the booth
Your wish list, K.Dot, yeah Im the truth
Stuntin, youd better get your broom
Cause Im flying with witches and were going to the moon
With this album, debut at that
Im so fly I might float with the bats
Yall know the most
Biggie and Pac, they behind me as my ghosts
Cause you think they write for me when I step into the drop
My shit is so sweet, candy flavored, no youre not
Skeletons in my closet
And no, you cant get up off it
This the freestyle, trick or treat
Halloween, better come with me, Im sweet
Pumpkins, smacking them across they head
And Im pokin eyeballs out on the web instead
He gonna gonna keep going
Baby, sex tape killed me
Ye, ye, Im so fly, right now Im so high
Matter of fact oh we talking about the hurricane
Im talking about New York, I pray for yall, know what I mean
I dont want that to happen, cuz if so I might just start rapping
Kim Kardashian, Wiz did that ass in
Coming straight from Compton, I thought yall know
I aint gonna look at the cards yet, cause Im bout to flow
Matter fact, this the perfect part to talk about them Lakers
Everybody thats disrespecting, yall the fakers
We gonna keep going, off the top of the dome
Mavs, yall gonna go home
Teach yall to come back to my city
Shrink you, G
Five times, four times, thats the repeat
Obama, we aint gonna talk about Ritt Momney
Because hes whack, fugazi, fugazi
I dont need to talk about the flow that Im in
If you gonna vote, vote for Obama
Hes gonna win, fo sho
And we gonna keep on going
Off the top, we just gonna keep on flowing
We gonna get back to this little punk, hes crap
Mitt Romney, show em how to rap
Matter fact, this freestyle is just dedicated to him
Youre homeboys right now with Slim
Your chances, youre not gonna win
You need to go back to where you came from, boy
Its the ruler of the game
Obama, vote now homeboy, hes got change
Whats up
Jay Rock checking in, you niggas checking out
When I grip the pen, thats how it is when Im on the mic
Im the Peoples Choice
The streets never lie
I paid dues so Im self made
And if you got something shitty to say
You get slept or slayed
Haters in the shade
They running they mouth
They steady talking till the gun in they mouth
Go ahead and chit chat
Thats when you hear the click-clack then its all over
Too late to bleed, squeeze then flee
Bleed the streets, bleed the beats
True story
Im straight gutter, all guts
No glory
You niggas whack with them same raps
Yall bore me
Youre all killers and dealers
With scrilla like Kobe
Cut it out, you rappers papier-mache
K. Lamar my nigga, go ahead and take em away
I said we dont wanna hear that weak shit no more
My flow China white
Like a sheep in the snow
I go deep as the Bible, I could debate with the pope
And you rappers go down hill
Like a ski on the slope
I been a boat with Papi
But I aint trying to cop no work
Im trying to cop me the boat and some more property
I told Rock
We gotta be more then just a commodity
Make the whole name and entity to infinity
Yall want me off the juice, no grenadine
Could stop me from thinking presidential like the scattered brains of Kennedy
After I shot, duck down
So the crowd wont witness me
Now, could somebody locate Mr. Shakur?
And tell these Tupacs, they two shots, away from two blocks
Of being neighbors with the Almighty Lord
I put your best material in, then fast forward
Kendrick, signing off
Im sure your signatures forged, boy
They say Im headed to the county and they said its for a murder
In a zone like a touchdown
No need to be turned down
Catch a fade, mandatory
Walk up in the dorm room just me and my heart
Let it start
Where you from?
I bang back
Start pushing back the rack
So I guess its time to scrap
Run that, Look
I Whooped his ass for an hour
Made his nigga have to drag him in the shower
Survival techniques from the streets dont apply in here
Just barbarious niggas wholl try your fears, ruthless
Little church choir and Hells fire
And lemme see you sing your ass out of this one
Smashed out a victim
Shouldve kept push ups in your routine
Eating tuna for your protein
Most niggas turn scary, fags get buried
Snatch a mothafuckas commissary
Dont worry Im a gangster
Look
First name Herbert
Last name Steven
Dont call it my government
Cause I dont know none of them
As far as rap
Im running it like Im getting robbed
Target wasnt quite my target
Thats why I quit my job
These niggas better hop on board
When my ship sets sail and I sell a few records
Sipping Guinness and set a few records
Enough is never enough
I gotta do extra
I gotta go the distance
I gotta prosper, I gotta put my mamacita
In that big casa
I gotta be the
Realest if not the illest to spit a verse
God MC, Pick a church
Hallelujah
Dont let the curly hair fool you
My hair aint quite wool
And my feet aint bronze
And its inadequate thinking I used to run Nazareth
Imagine if this hoodie was a crown of thorns
You wish you had the stamina to go that hard
Get your punchlines up, then maybe we could spar
Your lyrics should make a point, then maybe we could score
Then maybe I could show you how three met-a-four
Metaphorically speaking Im more indecent
Then papa bear getting distracted enjoying his porridge, peep it
In a war, I rip a warrior to pieces
Make a Domino effect, like Im delivering pizzas
And if that aint a fact, then neither is Jesus
Black-lipped bastard
Puffing on a pasture
I hit a chick till she holla like she caught the Holy Ghost
Then I passed her, holy smokes
I bring disaster to every quote
You a Shasta to a Coke
Im a master
Sensei with a pen raised
Build up bricks, just to break
In the dojo blowing do-do
And to be frank
Im so hot I make the snow flake
On any day
Ab-Soul, now you know mane
And this is for the homies
Im talking bout the swap meets, Rollie
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we...
Somebody get ready to pass me the hit of that endo, Im tryna get blown
Im tryna get turned up like the fifteens in my Cadillac Brougham
Looking for E.T. to phone home
Tadow, the flavor I kick reminisce the good days
Thinking back when we used to run in the swap meet for the Rollie chains
Pro Club t-shirts, whiter than Anglo-Saxons
Make it a 1X-Tall, crispy with the cotton fashion
Thats fashion if you come where Im from
Compton California, One love to the murder capital under the sun
Young niggas running around the street with heat bigger than me
But I dont trip, I still dip like salsa to a chip
Rolling down Rosecrans to scoop up my man, A-Mack
He talking about some foolishness on how we can pick up on some hoes, believe that
And so I scooped him round 3:30, Telling me its all good
Tiger Woods, Now we looking for the birdy birdies
Stopped at the sto to get some rubbers
Pulled up on the breezies, Well what do you know? I think they love us
And this is for the homies
Im talking bout the swap meets, Rollie
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we got it going on
And if you feel good 
Raise your hands high and throw up your hood 
Represent the city like you know you should 
I want to make sure that you understood we got it going on
 We got it going on
 We got it going on
 We got it going on
 We got it going on
As I continue my day, quite copacetic
Headed to my mommas house to see what them greens are talking bout, hungry as hell
Had the right grub, I bail, need some gas
ARCO station on Avalon, a relative hit me up as he rolled past
We used to stand in line for Jordans, excited we got em
Rocking platinum FUBU jeans with rubber bands tied to the bottom
Throwback jerseys, Chamberlain and James Worthy was two of my favorites
I might pull out the green Larry Bird on special occasions
But anyway Im steady coasting, smoking on that Hiroshima
Ashtray got a million roaches, Im focussed but feeling good
The homies hanging on {?} and Monte Carlos
Impalas and Tahoes, shoot something nigga, break that fifty
Im grabbing the city like Im supposed to
Making my presence felt like Christmas day, what can I say?
Every vocal is spoken with the wisdom of a G
If you cant relate then please have a seat
So, wherever you located, wont you let it be known
And put on for the soil of which you was grown
I put on like brand new Chuck Taylors
While giving you cuts like fresh tapers
Im such a fool with it, go nuts
You bullshitting like Tuck, the bounce then untuck
The bounce then throw up, a rare jewel, you duck
Take em to school I must, this for the cool in us
This aint for you, so what?!

Boarding completed Id like to welcome you aboard flight number F2B3
Our scheduled flying time will be four hours and twenty minutes
And we will be cruising at an altitude of thirty-three-thousand feet
At this time we would like to acquaint you with some of the features
Relax and breathe normally
Uh, coming down like Im uphill
Hogging both lanes better than a bus will
She tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel
But it dont matter cause she still gon let me fuck still
I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some L.A. weather
Then step out like Chicago in its finest era
You niggas begging for attention, doing extra-extra
Downgrading yourself, you get an F for effort
Ha-ha, I let the world know
I chose to keep to myself and let the world go
And if you dont like a nigga, then let your girl know
So she can be curious on Twitter looking me up
Im laid back with a bad one, you aint never had one
Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston
Speeding on the 1-0-5 till the fucking badge come
Hello to my wittiness, Im Cadillacs grandson
And Im a trip
Ever since an understudy man Ive always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you aint heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
Cause Im a trip
Landing on another runway, fly with me
Or die tryna fly, a shot-down Frisbee
Shout out to Black Hippy, nigga we on
Like we never been off, straight shots of Patron
Im give yall the business to give yall some business
Pussy aint shit, I can give yall some bitches
Clean off her sports bra, she clean off my dishes
Then wear off the Kangols, hood rats, I hate those
And she know what this is, hey lil mama
Seen your pretty ass around the way lil mama
But why you always in somebody face lil mama?
Embarrassing yourself, get off the stage 
Nigga, I gotta be that nigga
If I aint, I gotta beat that nigga
Curtesy of Paulas oldest son, pay homage
Or pay attention, open your eyes and hear knowledge
And Im a trip
Ever since an understudy man Ive always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you aint heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
Cause Im a trip
Gi-give me that, gi-gi-give me that
Thats how I get at em when I look at a shoe rack
Penny for thoughts, mine start at a few racks
So I can live on a hill just off a few raps
I want to live in a space that none of yall can visit
That might be outer space, the Jupiter district
I quadruple my vision
If you dont see it then youre dead with your eyes open
Ive seen bullets hit the wheel, left his ride smoking
On some Compton shit
Somebody thatll ride or die, thats a Compton bitch
You see my city is the city of Lamar
Itll take twenty years fore a nigga see them all
The swap meet dumping, the sawed-off pumping
The tree for the low, dont you know, Paul Bunyan
Im on cloud nine, I can see rain coming
So if Im out my mind, people dont say nothing
And Im a trip
Ever since an understudy man Ive always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you aint heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
Cause Im a trip
How was your flight Mr. Lamar?
Good, hope to see you next time
Bitch, yeah, ha
Compton most wanted, haunted by the ghost of the dead
Climbing out the casket, with a bullet in the head
All blue, all red, smothers every corner
Catch em while theyre young like the symptoms of pneumonia
Good ol California, killa California
Where the violence lives, and the peace remains homeless
Killers off the leash, at the mouth, they be foaming
Mad dog mad dog, my goonies be some mad dogs
Im in the booth zoning
Like 28 grams, of the good yams
Fiends line up in the morning
Im cloning, greatness
My words made of fire like Im rhyming about satan
I could burn through some braces
If I had em
This is the return of the dragon
Im not talking about, Bruce Lee
Im talking about, true heat
And it look like you got cold feet
Step into the flame and I might rekindle your name
Point blank range, as I take aim, at success
Put a bullet in the brain, then one more, in the chest
Im not thinking about no vest, that is not a factor
I rip through that like I rip through a rapper
Im not a rapper, I am a raptor
Dinosaur climbing on, everything that I perform
Mayhem, chaos, they pray i, fall
Victim of a fight, which is a gunslinging brawl
But Im all in all aware, that Im rare
Like a flying saucer hovin through the air
Kendrick dont have a spare, meaning theres
No two alike, you can bet it, and I guarantee Im right
Like a freeway exit, I hope you get the message
Before your T-Mobile lose service
And don’t log off AIM on purpose, you nervous
Aint you, Im ready to spank you
Discipline the disobedient hang em like Willy Lynch
Dont fuck with me
Im a furnace, burning, turn this mothafucka inside out like
Daddy mac, mac, daddys back with a brand new bag
And Im talking about, mo money pussy and pistols
Students please get out your pencils
Im about to break down the principles of the game
Dont complain because, it could be much worse
Whenever you took an L, know that, you could be taking a hearse
Ask you first, dont trust no skirt because bitches are the biggest liars
You playing with that you playing with fire
Burn 
Straight from the belly of the beast
Break it to the police
Said he put it on me
Im a ride til my wheels fall off with a G
Ride with the P, 89 creep
On him like a ninja, you entered the warzone
Your home Get bombed on, like an iraqi, and the policy
A guerilla warfare, that nothing is fair
We playin for keeps, no food no sleep
Im a warrior the coroner going to have to come and get him
Put him under the streets, and I guarantee
I hit em where it hurts, Im a lurk where he sleeps
His alarm clock beep, I be right there
Gun then knife, dead kids, dead wife
Dead bedrock head shot, Im a hit him twice
Then clear out the block, until theres no mo life there
Top dawg ENT, bitch we right here
We aint runnin
We be gunnin
Niggas talk alot but they dont say nothin
Chop em up, slice em up, he a cooked onion
Shake em down, break em down, throw em in a dungeon
Dont wanna brawl with 5-6 hog
Im a beast when I bark, every skyship fall
Ground shall break, part the seas and the greatest lakes
Anarchy is taking place, turn gorillas to bathing apes
Im a gorilla in every state
Your opinion dont mean shit mind yo business
Before I give your mind a business
Ask matadors I aint bullshittin
Bitches
Bleh bleh
My nigga, do you have a gas can?
Its just been a long ass day, man
All I need is a gas can
Im finna head over there and Imma be right back
(Fuck what you doing, man?
Knocking on the door extra hard and shit like you just stressed out or something)
My nigga, I dont even know where to begin, dog
Look, I woke up this morning feeling fucked up
What else is new? Like God be like, To hell with you
To tell the truth, I aint been to church in like three or fo
Years, not months, have mercy on my soul
Threw on the wife-beater, put a fitted on my skull
Took a long ass piss, grabbed my shades and hit the door
I had half a blunt left from last night
I lit that bitch up like a lightbulb and got right
Started to orchestrate my day like a maestro
I should hit the lab, I got verses like the Bible
I heard hip hop need revival
Its been camouflaged like the mascot for Geico
In that bullshit, I took another pull quick
My mind flooded like a fucking swimming pool is
Went back in the house, raided my moms refrigerator
But everybodys on a diet and my stomach aint quiet
I said, Fuck it, hit the shower like a jackpot
The weed got my teeth off-white like crack rock
Toothbrush from the 99 cent store
I got a million dollar smile, it dont make sense though
Threw on my army fatigue shorts and a T that say Peace Not War
Now everybody eyeing me
I dont know if I need an iron or its the irony
And by the way, Im at the gas station now
But not to get gas, just another black and mild
Shit this half a half a tank gon have to last until Monday
And its Tuesday, the bitches still want me like a bouquet
I hit my nigga Agent, he want to roll up two Ls like Cool J
Im like, Alright, cool, Jay
But I gotta be at work by 3, its midday
I cant go in smelling like weed, he said, Okay
Stop by the cheap tobacco store, two swishers for a dollar
And when he meet me, we finna get high, like a greeting
He told me, Drop five, I said, I got you next time
Long story short, I bumped my head on cloud nine
And Im chilly chill even when its hot outside
Rode to the studio rather blasted
I spit like a dragon thatll leave a fan flabbergasted
Thats when my gas and my check engine light
Clicked on at the same exact time I signal right
And that aint right, I got shit to do today
Cause any day you could be attending my eulogy
Got to the studio when everybody left
I saw a note that read, We went to go work on Detox with Weezy F
My fault nigga, I actually came up with the idea to write that
It was funny at first but
A day in the life
Of mister soul brother number deuce
Damn he nice
Im thinking if you only knew
You could fuck with it or middle fingers up to your whole crew
Tell em the regular nigga said it and that it
A day in the life
Of mister soul brother number deuce
Damn he nice
Im thinking if you only knew
You could fuck with it or middle fingers up to your whole crew
Now its 2:58 and Im running late for work
Running meanin stuck in traffic cause the Home Depot is finna jerk
I been in the same position before
Manager said it better be my last time, but it wont
I clocked in around 3:10 and Im wishing I didnt
Cause UPS just brought in this big ass shipment
And for those that dont know, I work at a record store
And I make hot records 
Finished the inventory then I logged on Myspace
I had one download and bout 16 plays
5 friend requests from sucka MCs making a name
I signed out and had to question my aim 
This old-timer walked in and we got to talking about Eric B and Rakim
And the perm on Al Sharpton
Osama bin Laden, Obama in the office
And he looked me in my face and said Im destined for fame
Told him I do music, he like, Whatever you do, do it
And dont blink, the moment you close your eyes, youll lose it
Word to wise, that was some great advice
That I took like I stole it, then my head sort of swollen
I guess thats why I shits on em like a cleansed colon
Told the rest of the shoppers we finna be closing
I locked up like Akon and hit the street
Its 8 PM, and I aint had shit to eat
All day, KFC, snackers a dollar each
Bar-b-que and nacho cheese
I bought 4, ate 3, gave one to Top Dawg
I wouldve had one for Punch but he moved like a sloth
Im back at the studio now if I lost ya
And everythings straight, you can thank great posture
Hit my lil momma up cause Im trying to cut
But she on the rag and I dont mean a bandanna
She told me come through, she gave me head like Rihanna
And I deserve a standing ovation for my swagger
Chuck the deuce, headed for the car to finish off the night right
But it wouldnt start
Laugh it up nigga, laugh it up man
Shit aint funny man, thats why I need that damn gas can
Shit nigga I aint got 5 dollars to put in!
Whatever man, bullshit dog, keep laughin
(Tryin to save that extra dollar for that menu
For the McDonalds menu nigga aint gotta cut all the time
Nigga you gotta put the whole 5 in it)
You gon shoot me 5 or what? Fuckin bastard
Greetings people
Youre now rockin with the best
Hub Citys threat
Minor of the year
K.Dot
I know the hoods been waitin, right
Imma stop being stingy
Imma share with yall
Whoever thought young Kendrick would spit, so ignorant
Make street disciples go and get a membership
Streets revival like Creflo Dollar hustlin on the strip
This is church
Advise you to purchase it or copy the worst
Yall rhymes sloppy, I rhyme properly
I jam pack Monopoly dollars by puttin 100% in every verse
Add 10% more and what do you get
A skinny nigga manipulatin the innocent
I have no sense, ever since the Rodney King riots
Mind militant, nigga dont try it
Try to hold the peace, for I promote violence
Yall dont rap
Yall make a lotta noise like sirens
So Im here to shut shit down
The four pound decorate your city
Make over your town
Im not Diddy, but still a bad boy
Til the reaper come get me, follow me now
Where no man has stepped, no man has repped
No man can withstand all the nights Ive slept
Under my sheets, no life, thinkin bout death
Fuckin with me, you just might lose your breath
Ill take you to them pearly gates
Them golden streets
Plus a cute little casket so your body can sleep
The Hub City shit is me
Do you believe
Its Kendrick the God
You never knew a plug, plug, plug, a plug like this
Sophisticated gangsta, watch me thug like this
Snatch your, uh, in a club like this
Seven zeros, need my pub like this
Stuck in a rock in a hard place
I am thinkin I wont bump yall up, well, I am
I got to get my thing off
My style come from Devin the Dude, Kurupt, 2
And James Brown with his fist crossed
I fluctuate the vocals like Prince Rogers
Whoever thought a billionaire come out of Compton?
Multiply simple logic, its rules you can follow
If Dre aint motivation, I dont know who is
Gift and a curse, maybe them shoes is too big
Or maybe Im too pessimistic to know Im gifted
Chasin hood rat brownie points and bullshittin
I dropped the four on em, scrapin, hopped a four on em
Grab my dick and pour on em
Yeah, homie, Im still talkin that whoop-de-whoop
Hoppin out on my enemies, I know who to shoot
Back when my homies where I need to be
Such a familiar sceneries, I smell the gun smoke
I watched a homie watch his son smoke
I seen the sun set on my set
I seen one Ru and one Loc, one slip and one played him close
Everythin subject to change
Nowadays, the Compton Crip car kill each other
Faster than an opposite color
Homies whack out everythin, youre dead, homie
Its your mother, your uncle and brother
If God was a Loc, hed probably had one comin
Damn, thats fucked up, I guess it is
When you cant trust not a soul inside these streets
I made a video out there in Copenhagen, so the homies can see
To let em know its more than just Pamela Lee
They said, Good looking
Paused the video the moment his phone ring
That fast dollar was his only problem
No matter how many times I showed him the Eiffel Tower
The block was home and Africa was too far for power
Then I knew
And you dont and you dont and you dont
And you dont and you dont and you dont
And you dont and you dont and you dont
And you dont and you dont stop
This feelin is unmatched
This feelin is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap
We dont share the same synonyms, fall back
Been in it before Internet had new hacks
My innocence limited, the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin, scratchin diligent sentences backwards
Visitin freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can visit a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin Benjamin benefits, sittin in traffic
Spinnin women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin in every decision
Kendrick is master and mastered it
Isnt it lovely how menace has turned attraction?
Pivotin rappers, finish your fraction, runnin pure magic
Thank God for rap, I will say it got me a plaque
But whats better than that? I know everything
I know everything, I know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything, I know Compton
I know street shit, I know shit thats conscious, I know everything
I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit, that isnt meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those thats hungry
I know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkies
I know if Im generous at heart, I dont need recognition
The way Im rewarded, well, thats Gods decision
You know, they know that from Compton School District
I give it to the kids, don’t gossip ‘bout how it was distributed
I, I, I know how people work, I know the price of life
I know how much it’s worth, I know what I know and I know it well
Not to ever forget until I realized I didn’t know shit
Big Boy, what’s up?
I don’t give a butt about no politics in rap
My little homie Stunna Deuce ain’t never comin back
So I got to go hard every time I jump on wax
Bump what they talking ‘bout, this here is where it’s at
Look, I came in this game, I stuck my fangs in this game
I wore no chain in this game, my hood, my name in this game
Now I double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
I’m stickin to the scripts like, “Yeah, em Benjamins can cuddle up”
I skip, hop, I drip-drop, I flip-flop with them white tube socks
It go sherm sticks, watch me burn this
That’s what the chronic smell like when them chemicals mix
Fifty-homie salute, I’m out to Compton Zoo with the extras
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans that eff with me
Nobody can eff with me, tell yall to eff with me
Jumpin out the Caddy, uh, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called
They said, The enemies done cliqued up
Oh yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everythin is everythin, its scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin, scramblin, football numbers slanderin
Homie’s name on paper, you snitched all summer
The streets don’t fail me now, they want to put the game in town
From Compton to Congress, it’s set trippin’ all around
Ain’t nothin new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin’?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Tell me they profit to fuck with you
Nobody can fuck with you, Obama said, What it do?
Can I get one more?
Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin’
Motherfuck if they did, then a niggad be platinum
Y’all priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don’t ask about no politician at award shows
No, don’t ask about my, hoes, no, don’t ask about my foes
Less you askin me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I’m the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box”
I box ‘em all in, buyin land stock
Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that Im mad
Dont you know no one alive can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad
But Im just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please dont let me be misunderstood
As soon as the beat drop
Within two bars, you already said Im hot
They savor, my fruits of labor
My flow is sweeter than strawberries, oranges, and apricots
God-dammit I raised the standards of the status-quo
To go against me you gotta be more than professional
You got to go extra hard like an erection with no protection
And I be fucking all these bars
We be sexing Im a nympho
For the instrumentals, all right, I admit it
Matter of fact I got a hot date tonight, real rap
Take this and take that from the machine
Got this money up, with no caffeine
Prepare me is Kerosene struck by a bunch of lightening
You looking at me then your sight seeing
And what that means is that this human being is fly, dont try to duplicate
Im authentic, I see you scoping my style like forensics, that is foul
Tech! Leave em by the benches
Im just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please dont let me be misunderstood
I see the future better than your computers
Apple software got the next 10 years scared Im Fred Krueger
Rugers on my hip, terminate all intruders
Leave them dead inside the sewers
Shoulda coulda knew I was a murderer
Burning up the very sun, the rapture
The god is back, they said hed come, but I came faster
Im not an actor, if you play Denzel, youll be thrown through a windshield
The nine merely is handheld, the AK is hands on
Now the battlefield I can land on one thousand mines and dont blow up because Im the bomb
Inside your CD deck, duck for cover, guard your neck, I demand respect
If I never see a check, at least I got these rap niggas in check
Preach Tabernacle fetch the holy bible if Im lying
King of my jungle, swear to remain humble, keep my vision tunnel
Because I dont need to get sidetracked, my producer name is Soundwave and he gives me beats by the batch
Im just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please dont let me be misunderstood
My flow cold, like Aspen
I love to show off when Im in that Aston
Look I act a ass, but Im not jack
A east side nigga I can get you popped at
A hundred rounds nigga stop that
You cant make that ass sit or flip-flop back
Im too gutta nigga top that
This is lyrical homicide, not rap
So dont get it misunderstood
Say my name on your bars, shit Im in your hood
With 45 goons 45 shugs
Chase your ass upstairs throw you of your roof
I see you big dogs, all I hear is woof
Loud talk, no bite, you niggas is puss
Im off that bubble kush, thinking about life
Or how to make a mill and spend it all in one night
I just might...
...Snatch your bitch if she got a great appetite
For the top dog catalog, that means everybody
Several bodies on the shoty dont make it eight rappers
Damn I hate rappers, dont call me that
If you called it how you seen it you would call me real rap
I dont fabricate shit, all I do is keep it real
Eat, sleep, and take shits wipe me down if you will
Hold up, big truck, lurkin with the monster grill
Four fifteens I got beat like Emmett Till
Put me in my g-mode schooling every hot-head
Tell them about the g-code, like eskimos
My arms froze, popsicle
Observing the game, Im so official
Woo!
Shoutout my hustlers, I mean
Everybody hustlers
You feel me
Look, look
I said, wake up, open up shop, get your hustle on
Selling pills straight out her crib, and break into another home
Tryna get in and out, get his double-double on
This aint my story that Im singing nigga, but this is another song
This probably your uncle song
Probably your big brother song
Your father or your mother song
I understand your circumstance so in your head theres nothing wrong
How you could blame how we behave?
If we paid and we aint getting loans
You dont know whats going on
If you aint live to see this shit I cant describe
Taking chances so they survive
This all happens just to take a life
In the end it was all for bread
And use the heat just to make it rise
Not sure how to raise a daughter
But they know to raise the price, so what you goin through
Tell a nigga what you going through
I could probably relate
I could probably be late
And still be on time for you
I could probably spit mind for ya
If you dont wanna tell your story
Its the same as yours, I hustle early in the morning
I said, wake up, open up shop, get your hustle on
Selling pills straight out her crib, and break into another home
I understand your circumstance, so in their heads, theres nothing wrong
But they dont know whats going on
They dont know whats going on
Wake up
I know only, trapped in the belly of the beast and its hungry
If I cant lay up in the streets I feel lonely
If I gotta break up with the streets I feel lonely
Yeah you got your car, yeah you got your gold
Your money dont fold but your mama still at home
Fam dont want your dirty money
You look clean, but your mother sad
Your girl felt neglected, now your daughter got another dad
Local block hustler, my father was a customer
Moms used to watch him buy his weed then she would cuss at him
Only for the weed, he felt free from that subtle bust
Moved back and it was primetime
And now Im on my prime time
But hustler turned pimp, doe
He was getting pimp dough
Now only selling his dope
But now he selling nymphos
Not so cautious about how he sells
Made his way to county jails
Now he lonely in them cells
How he feel
It was probably hell
He got out, but on that same shit
I guess when you loyal to yourself then you cant switch
But how can you blame kid
Dont know what he was goin through
Cause hustle is his bread and butter
He dont want no other food
But I wake up, open up shop, get my hustle on
Wake up early in the morn
Make a couple records, getting reckless on these records
Til these fuck niggas respect it
Go and get it, make a difference
Wake up with a new perspective, motherfucker
Wake up
I know only, trapped in the belly of the beast and its hungry
If I cant lay up in the streets I feel lonely
If I gotta break up with the streets I feel lonely
Justify the love of mine
For life of crime, my life and times
Is hard at times
I fall a time, like all the time
And then I dream for baller time
And then the clock rewind, and I
Wake up
I know homie
I know homie
Wake up
I know only, trapped in the belly of the beast and its hungry
If I cant lay up in the streets I feel lonely
If I gotta break up with the streets I feel lonely
Justify the love of mine
For life of crime, my life and times
Is hard at times
I fall a time, like all the time
And then I dream for baller time
And then the clock rewind, and I
Wake up
I know homie
I know homie
We aint chose this type of living, its what we gotta do
Part of niggas hear us cripping and drop out of school
Selling drugs or they pimping like some prostitutes
Living in a nightmare, Pinching is what you gotta do
Wake up
Hello?
Rise and shine, nigga
Bro, what you need, bro
What you on nigga? You tryna hit up the mall?
Hit up the mall? Nigga, I got like five dollars. I dont got no job

Iced out, Veggies shining maybe then youll know my name
Shout out my homies on it, specially from California
Man I be killing tracks, twenty years old writings on it
I got the connect, its time to get a lick
I put my niggas on then we generating checks
This slow as a cancer, I need a sponsor
Or go to Averys college and try to be a scholar
But the thing about it, got no dollars got no knowledge
I pray God help me prosper, keep me from imposters
I applied to school just so I can have some options
I need a couple mil, Im trynna do it big
If I never get my chance least you all know I live, I live
Peas and Carrots, thats my niggas
We blew up, you a eyewitness
My broad put his finger on her trigger
If any of you niggas come try and get us
But only call upon the shit you want
She lookin good and she got a donk
Im a take her down and then wake her up
And then let her know that I had enough
Rollin round the city with the homies in the Fo Do
Number 9 Jays matching perfect with the polo
Boxing out haters in my city like ?polo?
Girls with seven Ds, double Ds taking photos
Grab them cameras, let you know you aint dealing with no amateurs
Ask your girl, bet shell tell you all about my stamina
On the grind to the come up
Name through the city got me buzzin like a liquor but I never pick a blunt up
Fly chicks all in the whip, you will never be ?
But she really just admiring the come up
Funny what these chicksll do when you making moves
I had em propped for Veggies, picked em up right after school
This pimpin nigga
Gems drop, better listen nigga
Chasing all these hoes will leave you cold
Better pay attention nigga
Flashing lights, lavish nights
If I hit it once, Imma hit it twice
Cold game
Do it for my niggas trynna maintain
Got girls blowin like coal train
Throw a couple in the air like Soul Plane
Ridin roun town, mo change, mo steelo
New girl with me, but I keep it on the dlo
All these things goin down, what you think she with me for?
Look like she from Rio, sweeter than Tampico
Hit the eastside, the hoes call me Domasito
Crenshaw nigga, from Vernon ave up to Pico

Josh thats my people, Carrots get all the freaks though
Ridin Round Town, Im in the back while shes driving
Take me anywhere you wanna go, just surprise me
A lot of niggas hating, Im just now realizing
Your girl legs I will be dividing
Her pussy be open, my dick just be hiding
We just on the coasters, my niggas be riding
Everywhere Im going, girls be so excited
I went to your showing, no hoes got invited
Come put out the beat, that shit got ignited
My vodkas from Poland, Im not the politest
I might grab your ass, I know you finn to like it
I told you I cant drive bitch, police done took my license
So I be Just...
Ridin roun town, mo change, mo steelo
New girl with me, but I keep it on the...
And they all wanna feed my ego
When they wanna lay up in the front seat do
With the feet up, Beep Beep in the Regal
Baby hurry up, Skeet Skeet she go deep throat
Then Im rolling in the wind, Chi Town
Top down in the summer time, brand new number 9s
I be lovin that crap like its Cee-Lo
They be lovin my crack man Im Nino
She know that I see more C notes than you
Give me Chemo, home sick and I need help
But I hardly medicate myself, I doctor everything that I do
Ive been the one, since I was one
This game I got, it weighs a ton
These bitches go, these bitches come
She scream some more every time she cum
Orgasms and a lot of Champagne
Back spasms and diamond rings
Diamond cut, nigga its no cut
When I yell HiiiPower, TDE Gang
Im ridin round, Im ridin round
The corner from success, and I made a left
Then I got it right, now fuck your life bitch Kendricks next
Im talkin dick in the whole world
Your Ex and your new girl

As I ride around, Im right around the corner from success
Then I made a left and got it right
Now fuck your life, my dick is wet. Pause
Hold up man this my song, let me take it back real quick for yall
Its young Veggies
I prefer to just get the dome
Little niggas was at home
I was grindin 4 years on my own
Dont act like you cant see a nigga
In your past life you cant be a nigga
You can have an approach, make a lot of money
In the end you still gonna be a nigga
To the government, my covenant
Got attitude no Eazy-E
Po pos aint seeing me
Four shows and I need some tea
Young and going through puberty
But in high school man I made the Gs
My legal grind gon take me far
Im a porcupine Ill stab a heart
I shine hard off my heart
Gimme me the light like Sean Paul
Shell drop it low for this young nigga
Girl you should be askin to run with us
Baby girl Im just one nigga
I can only chill and have fun with ya
Big dreams make big figures
Ill wrap the city like big tigger

Going down and Im livin
In life you always get a choice
And I chose the right at that wisdom
Gone
Ridin roun town, mo change, mo steelo
New girl with me, but I keep it on the dlo
All these things goin down, what you think she with me for?
Look like she from Rio, sweeter than Tampico
Ah, the swagger
Dollar after dollar
Keep a bad chick with me
And I always pop my collar
If she ever got a problem
Get rid of her ass to solve it
Smash her at night
Then I kick her out in the morning
SWAG!
Swag
Swag
I woke this mornin undecided
My demons takin over my life, yeah
Sooner or later its a family divided
These patterns gettin hard to hide, yeah
They say I should be satisfied
They tell me I got the world, but thats a lie
I wished the way I feel could be pacified, sometimes
I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Oh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
If I told you Im bout to break would you look at me different?
Character out of place, would I lose your attention?
Let me know your intentions, cause lately I been watchin everybody
Its apparent that transparency never seen monotony
Got off of tour, lookin for closure
Mixin emotions of bein grateful and feelin like some of yall gettin over
Whats a puppet on stage, singin and dancin ablaze?
But trading his worth, distorted by the money thats made
A slave with a verse, I feel like Prince Rogers
I feel liberation is free, I feel I should miss the Oscars
Are you celebrating me as the artist or just a profit?
A question I have for the ones around me thats turnin toxic
My lungs been heavy from all the smokescreen boobytraps
Reminiscin on what it was, and knowin that this aint that
I vision a rock in a hard place
Hope my daughter isnt born with a piece of my heartbreak
You know stress carries on and your kids reap the mistakes that you made
And I admit that I can be dismissive if I cant relate
And I admit that I only commit to start playin games
And I admit that Im bad at talkin myself out of shame
But whos to blame when the crowds stop cheerin and they passin dirty looks?
I now understand that Ill never be understood
Isolation didnt work for me 
Socializing didnt work for me even
Prayed about it, didnt work for me 
You cant cure this disease
The pain too traumatic for relief
Pull up the curtains, let the audience see
I wish I was somebody 
Anybody but myself 
Oh, I wish I was somebody 
Anybody but myself
I was sitting on the couch reading yellow paper
A letter in reply, 7 days later after I wrote em
Stay strong, keep your faith in God, what I told him
Hoping that hes listening
Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
What a coincidence, I was bumping some Plies
I can taste the salt from my tears
As the water had start to flood on my eyes
I know it gotta be hard being 21
Doing time in the pen and your Grams old
Your brothers getting older
And the streets is getting colder
And your hoping that hes focused to stay on the right road
Sleeping in a cell, its been 30 weeks
Aint recieved any mail
Its cold and the hole stinks
And you cant even blink without niggas testing your life
As I read every word that you write, I can only imagine
Jason Keaton, I can only imagine
Lifes about decisions man
Its in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
Its in your hand and you got it
Sitting on the couch, that was my Uncle Bobby
After he just got out, 15 years to count
Havent seen the world in so long
Havent seen a girl in so long
And before the sun came up, he was gone
Like a fiend off the best rock
Trying to get his life together, or what not
Typed his name in the system and they couldnt find his identity
Got it straight, got a place, found some serenity
Found a job, found his Mothers grave site, found a 40 ounce
Then he found God, then he bounced, then he found a new chick
Two kids, wide hips, found something in her we didnt see
Found this spot in Pasadena and shack with her, an investment
Then found guilty, somebody had yelled domestic
Violence on my Uncle, was working with two strikes
Only out a year, now facing life
I can only imagine
Thats fucked up
I can only imagine, Uncle Bob
Lifes about decisions man
Its in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
Its in your hand and you got it
Sitting on the couch, thinking about the ratio
Of blacks in prison as compact in prison
When blacks pack with minorities
System grab more of these 18 year olds
18 year sentence with no parole
The state wont oversee
They make the term severe, a conspiracy?
Thats what I call it, its full of shit
A toilet can help quick, the government help?
No, just put us on death row
Just give us some more guns, then give us some more coke
Then give us another chair, then give us some more rope
Then hang it like right there, yeah
Its justice for all but 90 percent unfair
Care? No
Alcatraz was purchased by a white man
For 5 grand, with intentions to expand
More prisons
So these correctionals aint for rehabilitation
They for grossing a bigger business
Imagine
Were being used
Imagine
The truth shall be told
Lifes about decisions man
Its in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
Its in your hand and you got it
My people dont love me
Why we hate each other?
Why we kill our brothers, why we hurt our mothers?
My people dont love me
We can love one another
We should stick together because were all we got
My people dont love me
Why we ride on another, need to love one another
We all we got
My people dont love me
I said we all we got, I swear to God dog we all we got
My people dont love me
This whole worlds spillin senseless killing
Universe beyond evil, one topic to serve
Be my black people, we be missing the point like Shaqs freethrow
Sean Taylor, life gone because of haters
A nigga he known tried home invasion, went wrong
Bullet penetrated his leg, femur bone
Days later, wake arrangements, flowers to be catered
That was so impatient, take him from the next man
Cause he aint got the will to hustle like he can
Niggas would rather steal than think of a righteous plan
To get residuals, kill for dividends
This life is critical, we living in a time where
9-year olds tote 9s
Turn 10, its Mac 10s and coke lines
I wonder why successful black man gotta die from a black man
My people dont love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
My people dont love me
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, Im trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Black people dont love me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
Thats why today, black people lets love we
Cant be a positive black role model
Leading the future with no haters to follow
Now thats fucked up, if I ever wanna see
Success, I gotta see death? Be famous for what?
He aiming for higher learning, you aiming to shoot him down
He flying straight, you wanna u-turn him
You burn your brothers bridges
His accomplishments making way for your children
Still you dont compliment, inconsiderate black pride
No never been, never win, gotta lose
Thats the slope thats for the black heritage
We play the fool better than comedians
Disobediant dude no respect, ethics
I refuse to be a statistic
But changing my community dont seem realistic
Show me an African American doing right
Ill show you one that will kill his ass tonight
My people dont love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
My people dont love me
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, Im trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Black people dont love me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
Thats why today, black people lets love we
We stuck together back in slavery days
Martin and Malcolm them dudes paved the way
The bullshit we doing, I know theyre turning over in their graves
The shit need to stop today
Yeah the die for the cause, some like Jesus for us
To become better people, think about it
We used to run from the KKK
But now we running from our brothers that be holding them ks
Man, never thought thered be days like this
Cant trust your homies that youre hanging with
Damn shame, why you kill a nigga over a chain
When you could get up on your hustle and get the same thing
United we stand tall, divided we all fall
Lets leave this bullshit behind yall
On the real, the envy and the hate need to stop
Black people we all we got
My people dont love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
My people dont love me
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, Im trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Black people dont love me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
Thats why today, black people lets love we
Yall better wake up and smell the coffee
We all we got man
Its black on black killing each other man it needs to stop
Real talk
Black people need to smarten up
We all we got
Two tears in a bucket Ill cry with ya, huh
But I can never lie with ya
I can never afford not to afford
I can never put my plans to the side with ya
I can never see a red light
Like a deer with a head light
I freeze up when I re-up
See I really have patience
If you relatin, only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it
The reason why I never went to work for it?
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth, I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intention
They say time heals all
But if I could short cut my success motherfunk all yall
Whats up

Its payday and Im in the candy drop
So for real, Candy Rain flooding your spot
Firestone tires hot, burning the block
For petes sake Im a heatwave melting your dot
My ship sail, so I should move units and quick
The whip trail like a mixed, variation of chips
So when I dip, its kinda ironic
And all I do is hotbox Hydro, call it a carpool
Im from the west, where the Tecs is drawn like Cartoon Network
Wetshirt, a marksman will become my ex expert
Welcome to school fools, dont get an F for effort
Top Dawg money gang, winter fresh, sunny chain
Bad bitches

Sitting on chrome buttons, nigga no bluffing
Hit a club, all eyes on my neck
Got $20,000 worth of diamonds on my chest, nigga
Fuck VIP, Im on the floor chunking up my sets
Twisting fingers with my niggas, blowing swishers, sipping liquor, till Im pissy, fucking bitches, its so easy
Get the name, tell them the telly nothing but pipe in their belly
.380 keep it on my waist like a celly
K.Dot bout to bomb on you niggas, get ready motherfucker
I keep a big loaf of the toast, be careful when the toaster pop 
Hashbrowns and all, shooting out tater tots
Around 8 oclock I let it go for 8 a pop
Taking off wigs like Im working at a beauty shop
Im getting money, most success what Im achieving
Being broke is childish and most of these rappers teething
Still whipping the stick-shift, bottles pop, big sips
Green hash in the back, something to make my heart skip 
You aint seen a dresser thats fresher and keep it ghetto
Had a gat utter, sing to you; Reuben Studdard
See my team rougher, yall fat; cream puffer
Your broad serve the whole squad, call her clique fucker
Start to thinking that Im the best, just sort of speaking
More than decent, and fucking something thats Puerto Rican

Getting every dollar, Im steady stacking my cheddar

Super clever, outdoing me? Nigga never
Try to fuck me out my cash, dawg Im no pussy
Got big cajones, my nigga you cant douche me

Coming in wild, with 32 guns, and 10 guys, 3 Puerto Rican bitches, and a couple of 9s

Hustle like Im broke man, advise you to do the same
Nigga rob me? Better knock it off man
Shit, these niggas teddy bear soft

Bone marrow falling off, Mr. Swag dance, still lean, to the left, when they taking my pants
Try to play this MC like he was light, cause you can get it worse than Harold did at that red light
Pimping 24/7 like the day to the night
Now you mad cause your girlfriend giving head right
Moving through the block like a centipede
No rooftop, who hot? Imma show them where the antifreeze
I hit the dealership, and tell them hand me keys, like a grand pianist
Damage anything said, then landing on top of your bitch, oops I tripped
Im clumsy like Michelle Williams, or Jaleel White
I feel like a Predator, and none of you Danny Glovers are ready for, Alien tactics
The god is back, theyre on their knees praying like a mantis
As I perform like Santa Clause
Pause TVs in the Phantom
Bitches on my left and my right like I pant them
Dancing on the coast, emerging from the smoke
Pimping in my blood, tell doc to check my pulse
They knew that was K.Dot the gemini, with another cut like a Samurai
Anything else is uncivilized
Fucker
Uh, me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish 
Hit the house lick: tell me, is you wit it, ya bish? 
Home invasion was persuasive 
From nine to five I know it’s vacant, ya bish

Then Usher Raymond Let It Burn came on 
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish

The only thing we had to free our mind 
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs 
You lookin like a easy come-up, ya bish

And thats a lifestyle that we never knew 
Go at a reverend for the revenue

But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin all day

Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And thats just how I feel, nah, nah

Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And thats just how I feel
I had no idea who you were
Should have took my time
And opened my eyes
I had no idea who you were
Should have took my time
But my love was blind
You was caring, you was sharing, you was thoughtful, you was sweet
You was upliftin, you was different, you was commited, you was me
You was supportive, you was honest, easy going
You had promise, that youd never break a promise
You was life, you was free, from the bull shit
... I think
I had no idea who you were
Should have took my time
And opened my eyes
I had no idea who you were
Should have took my time
But my love was blind
You was insecure, jealous hearted, slight retarded
I was nauseous, I was marching back and forth, and you was forcin me to forfeit
Female fraudulent, you female doggin it
Its like extortion on my heart and shit
I probably fell for it, cause you was gorgeous
Now your course, done ran its courses, and of course you know Im exhausted
Time you know I surely lost it
Should of been wiser, should of been cautious
Should of been tighter with my game
I chose a dame that chose to entertain drama and what remains
Is hate, so fuck your fucking name
You fake and live in a hall of shame
Materialistic, egotistic, thirsty bitches
Open house, and mouth for niggas to stick they dick in
Thought you was different, but you wasnt
Take that back, I wish I would of just fucked with your cousin
Ass was fat, but never mind that
We out here fussin, fightin
Ask your friends to give advice, but they just like you
Clashing like some titans, could have broadcasted on pay-per-view
Promise that you never break a promise, should I trust you?
Now you only go for condoms, on late nights just because you, with the bull shit
I had no idea who you were
Should have took my time
And opened my eyes
I had no idea who you were
Should have took my time
But my love was blind
Im looking at the flashy lights and wonder, the price and number
Enticed by the glamorous ice, I wanna
Unite with the Hollywood twice, my concertll look like yours
And I wanted more than I could ever imagine, even a kicked-down door
So you can hear that Im rapping, see, I can hear encore
Struck by the fame bug, been fighting the same drug
The feeling that caned us in vain, its tough love
Please help me, please help me
Im on my knees, please help me, need you to tell me
Aint nothing bigger than you, I thought a Benzd do
But nothing bigger than you, aint nothing bigger than truth
And truth be told, the totem pole
Of non-believers just made the cattle blow
But I can see ya, even when my visions impaired
Youre many moons away, but still youre right here
You wont find him drinking under tables
Rolling dice and staying out till three
You wont ever find him being unfaithful
You will find him, youll find him next to me
You wont find him trying to chase the devil
For money, fame, for power, out of greed
You wont ever find him where the rest go
You will find him, youll find him next to me
Next to me, ooh
Next to me, ooh
Next to me, ooh
You will find him, youll find him next to me
When the moneys spent and all my friends have vanished
And I cant seem to find no help or love for free
I know theres no need for me to panic
Cause Ill find him, Ill find him next to me 
When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
When all I need is a hand to stop the tears from falling
I will find him, Ill find him next to me
Next to me, ooh
Next to me, ooh
Next to me, ooh
I will find him, Ill find him next to me
When the end has come, the buildings falling down fast
When we spoiled the land and dried up all the sea
When everyone has lost their heads around us
You will find him, youll find him next to me
Next to me, ooh
Next to me, ooh
Next to me, ooh
You will find him, youll find him next to me
Next to me, ooh
Next to me, ooh
Next to me, ooh
You will find him, youll find him next to me

Me and my troopers hoppin in this bitch, poppin in this bitch
Me and my troopers

Somebody tell my mama I might not make it home
Me and my troopers hoppin in this bitch, poppin in this bitch
Me and my troopers hoppin in this bitch, poppin in this bitch
Me and my troopers
Hey little heartache, skipping out of town
And let’s stay out of trouble, you make it look good
Hey young heartache, you’re looking kinda charming
On the cul-de-sac, where nobody comes looking
Hey, little heartache, turn us on the highway
Let’s get into trouble, you make it look good
Hey young lover, let’s live on the Broadway
Take me to the Bridge but be sure to come look
Hey young heartache, you’re looking kinda charming
On the cul-de-sac, hope nobody comes looking
Hey, young lover, turn us on the highway
Let’s get into trouble, you make it look good
And there ain’t nobody loving me, down
The way you make me go places I forbid
And the spaces I should have known
And there ain’t nobody breaking me down
The way you make me go places I forbid
And the spaces I should have known
Hey little heartache, won’t you leave your mark
In corners of the dark where you make it look good?
We’ve taken this too far
But let me play the part where you should’ve stayed put
Hey, little heartache, turn us on the highway
Let’s get into trouble, you make it look good
Hey young lover, let’s live on the Broadway
Take me to the Bridge but be sure to come look
Hey young heartache, you’re looking kinda charming
On the cul-de-sac, hope nobody comes looking
Hey, young lover, turn us on the highway
Let’s get into trouble, you make it look good
In the late week, I was in London
I really wanna get into something
Bus way too cold 
And I don’t wanna feel that numbness
And I just had a show, and I wanted you to go
But you had one too, I was wondering
Are the time gods on my side?
If so, God, press that button
Stuck on a tall-ass bus
Like 14 bunks and I can’t even sleep
And I hate getting drunk so I don’t got a cup
But I’ve got James Mason on repeat
I’m tryna stay on that good thing
You know?
Whatever song Heaven would sing
You know?
Broken up Alphabets
How can I get this convo to stay comprehensive
When the service is never working
And the Wi-Fi is out commission
And I’m not short with you on purpose
I’m a man of just few words
If you like to chat, then in fact
My job is to make sure you’re heard
Ms. Chatty — I’m like one message from calling a taxi
Exactly, I’ll catch a cold but as long as you match me
It’s actually a troublesome world when you think about it
So admit it, we both could look good with it if you’re the stylist
Hold up…
Digga-da digga-da digga-da da
Digga digga digga da digga da da
You stay in that dank lounge, Imma sit an decide
And P.S., the Olive Oils always love the Popeyes, I guess
I guess…
I sit on the studio couch
Ask myself, what the fuck am I thinking about?
Thinking bout living without the past and the present
A Dr. Dre record, imagine, I drift off, 600 seconds
10 minutes exact, letting my mind explore
K. Dot had turned Curious George
You know, off the hardship is what Im curious for
Like what if Pac had never looked left to holla at broads?
Before he turned right to get them shots through the door?
They say Suge did it, but he was in emergency clinic
So hed risk his own life to get someone else killed
But in the process, get injured, it dont make sense
Its like the Da Vinci Code, trying to solve the crime of these rap souls
What if B.I.G. never did it big?
Never went to L.A., would it make a difference in them bullet-holes?
Would it make my flow more persistent?
Would it raise up the bar of competition? Who knows
Who told Nastradamus baby momma was fucking with HOV?
Would the battle be less interesting if it wasnt personal?
If Jay wasnt intimate, thered probably be less people listening
People thinking its a publicity stunt
What if he partnered with Jay and still didnt blow?
Hip-hop would really be fucked
Something like Milli Vanilli
Nothing different, quite similar
Filling up my mind capacity
Thinking about Martin Luther, on the balcony
What if the shooter-
Better yet, what if Malcolm on the side?
Killed two birds with one stone, both wouldve died
Now lets rewind
Before we go, can you imagine?
Picture years with your mom
Can you imagine?
Hang her picture in the sky
Can you imagine?
Call emergency, Ive been dreamin all my life
Imagine if Tookie was a Blood? Look, no disrespect
But would there be more Bloods than Crips sets?
Dominating the population of
L.A., Orange County, the Valley, and back up to the bay?
Matter fact, imagine if we didnt really start this gangster shit
Yall wouldnt have nothin to spit
No drive-bys, no flags stickin out pockets
No N.W.A. dudes, just rappin like Cre Cru
Imagine if Mike Concepcion walked on his own two
Feet no paralyzed, would he be alive?
Or would he been lost his life to the streets?
No match, no cars in that driveway
What if Freeway Rick never was a kingpin?
On this L.A. strip, would these rap niggas use his name?
Nah, what if rap niggas never had rap?
Would they try to fall back on this drug game?
These rappers ass backwards
Now these rappers getting caught with the cocaine
But to smoke, not to slang
Imagine that people not knowing these rap niggas insane
Just think about it
Before we go, can you imagine?
Picture years with your mom
Can you imagine?
Hang her picture in the sky
Can you imagine?
Call emergency, Ive been dreamin all my life
Imagine life without death, would you even feel alive?
Your people that passed, what if they never died?
Imagine seeing your mom cry, tears of happiness
Knowing her son safe, and she aint lose him to this madness
The street living, what if the crack epidemic
Never reached the projects and destroyed our buildings?
Turned most of us to killers, innocent victims
Imagine if heroin didnt affect our system
They say drug money funding the labels today
What about the drug money thats funding the C.I.A.?
Imagine if they really tried to fix these streets
Would they start in the hood, or executive suites?
Where the real criminals meet, and principals beef with me
You could possibly live without heat
Imagine if Al Gore had won that election
Would the Twin Tower buildings still stand erected?
Imagine the penal system without witness protection
Would there be these many cowards on the stand telling?
I dont know, Im just speaking my mind
Lost in my own soul, Just press rewind and imagine
Look, tell me what you really wanna see
I had the greatest experience shooting that video, What’s it Gonna Be?
I had to say it wowing, my heartbeat started pounding
Walked on the set while she got dressed
In cock rings on her outfit
Janet, why you doing this to me?
At the time I couldn’t believe we both were starring in this movie
Youre in my video, you know a nigga loved it
I spent 2.4 million on the fucking budget
All my jewelry flooded, see how the kid was on?
First rap nigga album you’ve ever featured on
And I was weak in the Lord, despite the things we said
My first words to Hype Williams is “I can’t believe this dream”
Shot a solo scene, I tried to make mines better
But I love when we shot together, and we rubbed up on each other
But I’m a little jealous, Tip, your tongue went in her mouth
In that Poetic Justice movie, from what I can account
You know what we be ‘bout…
Any time, huh?
Any place, baby?
Now, you know, at the time, I was really
I really had my crush on shorty, man, you know what I mean?
Yeah, I was in love with shorty since she was
Penny and all that on Good Times and shit, you know what I mean?
Ayo, Kamaal, you’s a fucked up dude for doing that to me, man
You broke my heart with that, man
Come on, Buss, you know how many dudes say that to me? Like…
Once a day, girl, truly
We grew up with her through the lens of a camera
Didn’t have much, but dare said I’m having her
Shorty was the joint, here’s my case and point
Me and ‘Pac rollin’ L’s in the trailer
Both of us get to scheming how to nail her
First movie about to come out in the theater
Pleasure principle, butt to the makeup truck, so ill I gave her my code
We kissed, I took her control, we swapped as all the film rolled
A marathon, we kept this good thing going, sunset, the moon, it came on
In my mind it would prolong
Listen, the scene was deaded, but I wanted my own edit
Me and Justice kissing keep it going, two pros with credit
A memorable summer in ’92 out in Cali
When I got back up top my niggas asked about the fatty
And did I smash her madly, to that I had to answer
Negative, but I’d give anything to be her dancer
A captivating lady, I used to be her baby
Good Times, they never fading
Look back and celebrate Poetic Justice
At any time, and any place, I don’t care who’s around
At any time, and any place, I don’t care who’s around
In the thunder and rain, you stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand moving up my thighs
In the thunder and rain, you stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand moving up my thighs
Been ready
Jay, I been ready
HOV, I been ready
They say patience
Everybody wanna know why my game plan so strong
Cuz I aint gotta think with a light bulb on
Nigga I eat, sleep, and shit rap; I never relax, been a busybody since I was born
Is he really fucking with Sean?
I reply, His pick, I would take a tool on.
Dolce brown nigga, Im right now, you aint gotta wait later
Where the CD at? Put it in the disc player
Tell ho ride to it, I do it like none other
K-Dot, definition of a young motherfucker with a problem
Future of the West Coast I am
And thats real tough
Southern California, Angels, AKA LA Sharks
Make comparisons when I seen him duck
Man you think What was to Pac and Big, before?
And that was before
I picked up a pen, and when I did, my thumb and my index sore
And then I started writing with it
Found that it flows better, like a Venice Beach sea shore
He dont wear the same clothes as yall
He is cut from a different cloth
Ya boy is cool, but Im a different frost
Like igloo, every time I come off
Every time I take off
Pandemonium when I take off
They hanging on the wing of that G4
30,000 feet and still wont fall
Why you do that for?
Why you had to sell out that store
You made my record sales come up short
My reply is that it aint my fault
Blame God
I cant wait when its my time 
No I take that back, cuz I got time 
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you got time before I hurt you
No lie 
I cant wait when its my time 
No I take that back, cuz I got time 
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you got time before I hurt you
No lie 
When the lights get dark
And every body quiet, know its my part
I might start a riot
The main event
Bulletproof under that black tent, you cant shoot through shit
I never played the bench
Star Point Guard
Never pass up money, Im a ball hog
Touch anything I get my hands on, into pushin like Ray Charles
I never had no flaws
Ooos and Ahhs after every bar
Take your bitch, then give her back
For no reason for, just because, yall actin hard
Im bein myself
And I got some plastic under my belt, so rest assured
You dont want your moms thinkin bout pullin that hospital cord
Went from a Honda Accord, to a Bentley Azure
Back seat got a flock of broads
And I aint gotta say to kiss it, just like Sure
Momma gon clean or fix it
Use Terrific, Easter Brum????????
All it need is a little season on
Who said a veteran cant be so young?
I sound better than half yall on
Damn K. Dot, let me see your arm
I aint gotta do a show, my jewels perform
I aint gotta do a show, my jewels perform
Princess cut looks stupid dumb
Eyes close shut, all I see is dollar signs
And I wont get enough till Im layed in the grave or hand cuffed up bout one time
No Lie
Blame God
I cant wait when its my time 
No I take that back, cuz I got time 
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you got time before I hurt you
No lie 
I cant wait when its my time 
No I take that back, cuz I got time 
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you got time before I hurt you
No lie
Yo, Ab-Soul brother number two
What it do, Tony Touch knock beats like I knock boots
Propaganda when I step to the rest of ya
You know they make it bigger then what it is in particular
Kendrick Lamar the modern day Malcolm
Humble and modest but these margins can move a mountain
I moshpit on the beat and leave the mark of a thousand marksmen
Clearing the street and killing rappers with talent, preach
Yes I said talent, Kendrick aint scared of yall, can’t even spell competitor
Lord is my witness
I remember asking artists in streets how they did it
The only features I got is was this handsome face I was getting
How ironic, playing Sonic was the shit like a colonic
Now we vomit over these beats while critics pay homage
This is too street like my 23 summers in Compton
I go so deep, like my dick in your bitch hope the condom never do leak
2 seats, one car, all you hear yes daddy and snapped bras
High salary blow jobs, high calorie rap bars not me
My sweet 16 probably need a school ID
And usually I be, the dominant victor
You know what time it is nigga
Affirmative Action, you fact or you fiction?
I’m a slain cracker from being insane
Pop a vein when I write this shit
I’m think on the shit, Im vain and I think you’re a bitch
A female poodle under some homos voodoo, sucking the industrys dick
We catching bodies, fades in the hotel lobby, fuck your security
And thats at the Ritz-Carlton
My impuritys probably your best asset
I spit acid, hit your block and crumble your address
Leaving them stagnant
This is torture when I tort-ya, or escort you
Out the building where ex-convicts with all sorts of
Permeant handshakes, your man can’t stick to the script with handpaint
Popping your lip then popping the clip then popping your van, wait
We keep the piece, but want the peace
Said I was Malcolm to your belief whats up
Aww man they let a gangsta in here
Awhuh, Looking for hoes who gon strip down to there swim wear
Aww, Since I got older n made an escape from our family
Niggas been causin casualties for any sucka or super sweater
Say they can handle me huh
I feel assaulted like, fuck around and get charged with battery
Awwhuh, Energized, Blue ball Im high as wings, we fly to find the things
On fire, Im carousing, n kick it like soccer teams, who spit it as precise as him
Awhuh, got a dirt job for that, uhhh, yo, choppa that hoes a beam, 
Everybody focused on this animal
So one who push the envelope, the remedy the antidote
Mix the Henny and the Coke
Sell the tree and the dope, rain sleet and the snow, do we sleep? Hell no
I Pop a tag and pull up in a Elco
Bag a bitch at Elco, run up in her tailbone
Grindin cuz I sell mo, hotter then that hell boy
Fresher than an altoid, see me in them tabloids
Actin like a damn fool, running from them bad boys
Keep a Will Smithon Wessen
Big shell out my weapon, hit you like an astroid, get high wit androids
Im outta space wit this shit
Pass the L to Elroy. I aint took a L boy
I aint never lost nigga. big heat on me blood
Click defrost nigga. Lookin at a boss nigga
Fuck you an yo boss nigga, Iron on me ever see a hunnit play golf nigga
Get chastised for your raps with mad lies
See mathematically I divide you academy
Multiply the digits, spend it foolishly on women n Benzs
Jewelry or new Benzs, two or three
Who but me cool as Lupes CD
Or cooler then the Shade when its 80 degrees
You wouldnt qualify if you had 80 degrees
There aint a place or a horse that stay stable as me
You.. 
Feeling like a motherfucking animal
Hannibal Lechter of 2012
Elected to execute every rapper that has excelled
If music your calling
Then you balling, pick up yourself
If a nigga said he could see me
Bet he told you in Braille, fucker
Put you on front street, then buy some bread
Nigga you lunch meat, shouldve worked at Subway instead
Goliath couldnt bare my triumph
Im a leader, walk behind me as I walk through Zion
Swinging swords like Im sparring with a Spartan
Watch they face drop when the beat drop
I drop a real jewel like a Martin, fool
Me and curtains ballin like peewee kirkland callin em kirk franklin
Stomp em, leave em hurting
No judgement for a plaintiff
They tried to find me guilty for spitting filthy as O.D.B
But Ive been O.D. since 03
Thats March 14th, my first recordings
I kicked its like sweet chin music on Chuck Norris
Look, Look, Look, Look, Look, Look, I tell em
Im just an average black man, gotta take a stand
If I dont I will fall short, gotta have a plan
I dont know my destiny, Lord knows Im stressed, but he woke me up this morning, its good to say Im blessed
In this game we call life, gotta know the ropes
If you dont you get tangled, strangled till you choke
People think they know, think they know whats really best for me
They say that I aint swaggin enough, I bought necessities
They sai that I aint rapping enough, I need some concepts
Man they listening slow, or they too deaf
Shit I got what it takes to be a star
As soon as Im on man they wanna shut me off
Shining with the sun here they come with there clouds
But I aint giving up shit Ive been runnin for miles
If you ask around, they say Im the one in the town
Jay mutha fuckin rock, knock a shit down
Look, Look, uh, they say lifes a gamble
Im just glad that Im winning, ya Im glad that Im winning
Uhh, They say lifes a gamble, huh, but Im glad that Im winning
Shit Im just glad that Im winning
All these niggas cant fuck with anybody in my circle
Squares take a pair to this shit we droppin right
Im extra high, Im extra right
Now Im freestyling like what the fuck is up, fuck me up
Where the blunt at, can we smoke in here
Say Ab-Soul wheres the blunt, can we smoke it here
Got some mo weed, Hennessy, bitches in here

You see how we do, right off the top no glasses
Just me n uhh, Kendrick Lamar, we...
After non sense, Im live and direct with a dead compass
On my way to Carson from Compton, steady mobbin
You know my squadrine, Black Hippy
All I need is a pack of Black & Milds n an ounce of sticky but I aint picky
Black lip bastard, black T lets back track
Malcolm X was a government scene, Black causality, Black
Thats too deep, and Im the bomb
Thats like C4 on the sea floor
Fuck wit A.B. n you can see more
Soon as I touch this money, Im an act of Eeyore
And as soon as Leor puts up a couple mill
Im a drop a classic album, put up a blunt n chill, get the deal
Its Ab-Soul actin an ass, bout to cop a number 22 at Jack in the Crack
At the crack of dawn, I know Im a lab rat, Im up at the early morn
Morning the formula to be as big as Madonna with my raps
Call me what you want just dont call me ignorant
I figure since Im in it I should be the biggest in it
I even grew my hair out out get a little image
And for the record Im mixed but what ever you wish
Ab-Solo Black lips, black polo, 
Uh ohh, blowing dodo in the dojo
Yea thats right you better walk away
Go on and walk away cause Imma burn this motherfucker down
King Kong aint got shit on me
Running them ghetto streets, I aint cooking up nothing
But I got the tea kettle on side of me, that metal on side of me
I dare you to follow me, Im double daring you to follow me where the drama be
His momma in debt, so she cant pay the funeral fee
So wherever them candles at, thats where the funeral be
Kids dont get sleep, guns keep em up real late
Walk in the school, shells laying on the concrete
Take em to school, show and tell, for that final grade
She gave him a F, I say that young boy deserve a A
Cause she never slept where he slept, or seen ricochet bullets rip
Through his cousins face, ripping his face off
I aim the fifth straight, concentrate like Im playing golf
Im Tiger Woods with a gun in my car, I keep one in my car
And keep a bitch with implants, so she keep one in her bra, boom
Shit, make room for the lil bastard
The flyest nigga you seen on centennial campus
The eight ball tucked in my jeans while Im getting patted down
They didnt know I had it on me, stupid security
No one securing you, if Im gon touch you
If I dont like you, the Mossberg pump love you
I take that back, it probably just wanna go and fuck you
Go with you, then dump you inside the coneal confortable
Defending my belt, depending on nobody but myself
Unless you talking bout money, I need yo help
I need some help, they say that my screws is loose
Like handlebars on mongoose, this is true
You tough rappers, Im talking to you
He aint on no used to shit, but you see his face grew
He say that he fabulous, but really dont have a clue
That he just a puppy living in this zoo
Shit, whoo, with that said, you should know I am the truth
The truth hurts, you should feel pain when Im done with this verse
Im done.... psyche, I aint finished
Ever since the first grade, been bad with the run-on sentence
I never sat the benches in the game of life
I played the whole forty-eight minutes, Christ
I rap with precision and lyrics, is grandma nice
Im cooking up something, you want you a slice? Then get it
Im holding my stomach, Im shitting, Im farting
On any rapper thinking Im in his vision, is you retarded?
The CL got my head spinning awkward
Bought it last month, bout to put it up for auction
Im not rapping, Im talking powerful
And for that dirty money, boy, the Macll shower you
The Mac disintegrate, and then devour you
The magll forget you, regurgitate and sour you
I world trade you niggas, north and south tower you
Steroid, my authority overpower you, the industry aint affording me
They might as well just give me my money and start ignoring me
Cause yall niggas boring me, yall aint making no dollars plus no cents
I swear, yall niggas foreign to me, foreigners
I tell you what, go and tell it to the coroner
Killing em whenever my performance come
When I do it, it wont be nothing right after Im done
When I ruin niggas careers, put you niggas in tears
Get you pom poms, you better off, cheer for me
Shit, the new money is here for me
Chyeah , chyeah, chyeah, chyeah

I was born in Zion, I defeated the Lion
Soul made of iron, yeah, Soul made of iron
Nah, nigga talking how you cant fold when you trying 
Strive for triumph
Survive by any means necessary even if it means dying 
Fuck the world, missionary ; Malcolm got popped 
Obama got in office, and Im still on the block 
Aint shit changed, the grinding never stops
Call it progress, and the reason why the chicks always fall in our nest
Two niggas getting high, flying objects Yes!
We got next, now forever the Hippy is black interrogated by
Instrumentals that give me a rhythm
Put the maize together and blaze , hey

He kept his distance, I kept comin over and stayed persistent
You bitin your lips, toes twitching and she crinching
Steamin up the bathroom til we left it a sauna
I beat it up and now you usin my tee as pajamas
Your friends tried to warn you about me, even your mama
But you said youd deal with the consequence, even if it was karma
But how can I complain when you give me insane brain?
Like you graduated with honors, you probably hate that Im honest
But, fuck it, Im going all out

Tonight, were gonna get badder

Now here we go again, from the bed to the floor again
I hear your phone on vibrate and I know its him
But thats what happens when that kittys in the lions den
You start lying and changing places
You mightve been, I mightve been too aggressive
But it was far from desperate
I mean, the swag I got, just know its half the effort
They tryin to toot my own horn
But, shit, I sworn that I swarmed up in it, stamped and fingerprint it
Left the coupe tinted when you played the passenger
Dont be passing up til we finish
What we started, you with it? Im with it
Then lay your seat way back like it was vintage
While I hit the highway and slowly puff on this spinach
Camouflage emotions got your feelings wide open
Im hoping you come to grips
At least before you provoke em to trip
But thats inevitable, and if I put you on a pedestal
That means Im fuckin you on a chair
Tonight, were gonna get badder 
Youre gonna get wetter 
Were gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, well love
Now dont you no worry about that
Whatever you want, Im on that
So dont hesitate, girl, when you lonely
Baby, dont worry, we know that I got you
Now that I got you about they thinking out you
I want to stop and I dont want you to stop that
Ow, we in a phase, oh, I cant wait
Cause waters dont label you, oh, no, no
Im from, came from the bottom, so just get on top of that
How about with the top back with your top back?
Take that off, uh, ooh, ooh, break that off more, more
Tonight, were gonna get badder 
Youre gonna get wetter 
Were gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, well love
I return before tables get turned
It’s my turn, spur of the moment
They re-produce my sperm and try to clone it, stand firm
Bumping The Firm, Phone Tap, I’m on it
I slaughter every opponent to bits of components, potent
You can’t fuck with the horse power, your woofing too much
Y’all bout to hoarse coward, as soon as I buss, pause
You put your hands on a broad and telling me you can brawl
You thought you saw me when you saw Saw, frightening
More reckless than a paisa driving without a license
Hittin’ your new truck then leaving you hiking
They said no, the industry let it go
I cracked the window then hit the back door like trick dices
Stickin’ and movin and movin’ and stickin’ the prices
Uppin’ the ante before Im a antique, can promise you hear me clear
Even if you eat 3 ears with Tyson
Rippin’ the panties but bootin’ the wammys
They dyke and I’m liking them all, I’m siftin’ through panties
Haters’ll spike it
Voicing opinions but holding laryngitis
But I don’t hear ‘em, I’m a winner by law
Track em down like the subway when they sub-par
Sub-zero everytime I jump in the synagogues
Send the angels, send the God
I can make you look hard, I know
I just let the thoughts take its toll
More sentences than level four of y’all, Bogard
Go hard, black tar, concrete, Tom Vick times Papi Mason times 3
Uncle Toms need Tums to stomach atomic bombs
Or die from my Wizardry
RZA, GZA, Method Man
I’m a killer B, killer! Be killed, make your embassy yield
This is not your cup of tea, and oh
They say waters run deep, dive in, Bermuda triangles
And you will see us, we must leave dust behind
Emcee’s duck, deduct, revenue declined
When we touch down like a Running Back’s grind
Can you keep up and keep us safe for keepsake
That aint safe
Compton!
What’s happening y’all? It’s Terrace Martin, ay, so check it out
I got three microphones, three of the dopest emcees, a drum machine, two turntables and a mixer
That’s all we need man, we’ll pass the first mic to Kurupt, yeah
Im the militant military
Bald eagle, squeezer, Caesar, Ebenezer
I am the worst 
Thats what my bitch told me after I took her purse and shook her down
Looking for a pound in that purp, bitch
Im scandalous, I poke you like deer antlers, cancerous
Cause I aint got no time to play
When I ask you a question, answer is the lie where you lay
Lay where you die, never wake up die where you lay
Its hard to survive nigga or the high where you stay
Im important like the Pope, Im the king of New York
Im live from South Central, Im a Muslim on pork
Kurupt the worlds fetish, they feen and scratch
Im multiplied by twenty thousand fiends and crack
You add me to music and the fiends react
Everybodys addicted, turning bodies to liquid
I love your style but I hate your vibe
I dont want your wife but your bitch is mine
Murder methods of mayhem, tap or dap up the great
Arsenic rapper, sodium cacodylate
Wizardry, misery, young Merlin
She’ll love me, I make her walls fall like Berlin
You ever heard of a murderer, well you must of my nigga
Im a mixture between Big, Snoopy and Jigga
I spit meat cleavers, Im saucy as Picante
My wifes a diva like Beyonce but hood like Shante, motherfucker
I run amok on busters
They call me Kurupt, forget that, I fuck you up
I sizzle these motherfuckers in the inkling of a second, murder method
Ay yo, where my Compton homeboy at? Kendrick Lamar, haha, yeah
Kurupt, let me erupt 
Like flammable gases under the Earth’s crust 
My flammable passion can get the Earth crushed 
It’s 2012 once I unveil lyrics that can derail a train of a subway entrance
Say I bust like Jerome Bettis and that’s a must
Offended the best, magnum on my dick defending my flesh
Seven holes like a clarinet
Clarify your worthiness or foresee funeral services
Affirmative action pop up on your furnishing
Unfortunate future for us to fly free under God’s firmament
Me versus whosever’s dead, that’s God’s tournament
Kendrick the Arthritis, hand that hates to write this
What’s good, I’m in your hood like workers of Midas
Purpose is to be righteous
But my Malcolm X is extra’d out like a crip yelling his hood out when he fighting
I never seen a key, all I seen was a triton
I’m always kicking up dust, I’ve never been hiking
I’ve always had a licence for this hip-hop
Influenced by the rap that vocally said they killed cops
I’m riding on E with a bitch that pill pop
Now that’s the irony that I give you when the zip lock
Bag and sell it at doo wop, after that pass the doo wop
Lick a few shots for the few blocks that we on
For ain’t no beat that’s flawed or unique so please don’t try to Xerox
Copy written, niggas bitten
My style since I was backflipping
Inside canals, LA gears with the laces missing
Me Against the World in the background, mama had gave me bowl cut in the kitchen
Big cousin became a statistic, I chose the right flows and remained consistent
Voila, now they got me, haha
Expectations is high, Compton or Bed-Stuy
To them skinny niggas in the Chi bumping Common
But the only thing in common is crime and more violence
I play a little game, you say you fly, I’m over fly
I’m the pilot that’s left on the plane, cloud nine
That’s where I’m at with it
Punchlines till your jaw dented
Catapult your Buick till your car spinning
Watts up, Bad Lucc
Believe me, I’m Martin Luther and Jeezy
Hard to shoot and they need me
Created from a grain of sand that’s rolled up in a rizla
First time I met the RZA, I reminded him of GZA
Back then I was a cold little nigga painting pictures
Avalon did that, six pack
Raised by them killers that’ll never bring them kids back
Tiny Archibald on the dirty side of law
I was inches from that building till my bitches tucked the raw, I’m lawless
Hell to the supreme, I should beam that beamer for gleaming
And blame it on that lean cause I’m leaning
The movie is rated R, Shady, huh
Dick off his lady friends in a Bentley, huh
You ain’t seen us in a while, jack
Rastic, I’m god and a buggy is a mousetrap
You’ll become about that, big homies ain’t out yet
Youngins run the city or the biddy like I’m about that
Sharpen my tools, step out the kitchen homie
Young Drake from kitchen told me that street shit is what they missing from me
Is so I’m outside with the Eastside
Sound of the piece and the heat flies
Flat fleece, the fleece bang when niggas get DP’d at beef time
Warren, no Griffin
You listen, you’ll be held accountable to what I’m spitting
I’m Johnny Cage with Timberlands mean I come with me
You got the blogs, I got the streets
I guess we even, not really
I’m cut from a different cloth, rappers pissing them off
Serving drinks out of gun stores, cocktails is Molotovs
I’m bored crazy in a booth, if I don’t get that coupe soon
I swear to God I’ll turn Hip-Hop Awards to a saloon
Move, make way for the fat kid with an attitude
If I batter you, I cook that last meal to faggot food, on mama’s dough
You sugar puffs and honor rolls
I’m angus like, Genghis Khan in my video
You can’t stop it though, from P.F. Changs to Pappadeaux
I eat a nigga up like Dominos, yeah
Yeah yeah, ay so there you have it
Terrace Martin
Kurupt, Young Gotti
Kendrick Lamar, Compton stand the fuck up
Bad Lucc, Watts stand the fuck up, you feel me
Crazy Toones, South Central, what up hood?
I’mma get the fuck outta here, man I’m done, man let the shit talk man
Im on some other shit
Yeah, me too?
Im on some other shit
Yeah, me too
Im on some other shit
Yeah, me too?
Im on some other shit
Yeah, me too
What you on my nigga?
Im on some other shit
So what you on my nigga?
Im on some other shit
So what you on my nigga?
Im on some other shit
Ha ha
Black Hippy
My mind traveling through different dimensions
One of the reasons why they tripping off the rhymes that Im kicking
Like a Sensai with a black belt, Im that felt
Give yo ass some pretty wings
I handle Macs well
Arm less sergeant salute me
,Ab-Soul-Loutley
On some other shit leave the booth full of dookie
Off the head like a noogie and my lifes like a movie
Play your role while I roll another doobie
To smoke
We got em high catch another quote
Look in my eyes, never lie boy Im on my toes
Like a Korean with nail polish you niggas know
Acting like you dont oh fo sho
Tell em soul!
Ha ha!
You know we out your galaxy
An astrologist couldnt find a better analogy
Actually we the last of a dying breed
Living life like its prophecy entirely word up!
Black Hippy
Thats all I need to get busy
Turn your music to a Frisbee
Then make your bitch frisk me 
You be holding rifles hoping that someone will like you
Searching for a pill like the late Michael
Thats dead wrong
Um...Keep my heart strung
Still fucking hoes like an off drum
Sound of a kitty cat
And its still a rap beat
How you feel on that
Well Ill sell our music and make moves in the 50 states
The irony is Im in Compton with foreign plates
Bumping Angel Milk, homie play your part
I be coming down, you coming up short like an Asian bill
Um....I think I need to get my shit together
But whatever still flyer than the weather
Feeling myself so much
Im sharp I need more tunes to sever
And my polos made of leather cuz
Black Hippy
Killing the game oh yes I am
Bringing the pain as I am
Youre just a sweet potato in the pan
Top Dawg is the label when its written on my shoulder
Top notch on my hand, Ill be such till its over
Say hello to the man in demand would ya?
They say when you hot then the fans will come
So if I say Im cold then thats an antonym
You cant stand it huh?
Uh, yo yo
I freak a beat like a nympho when I speak
And so a syllable is like a sex between the sheet
And you can buy your vowel if you show em the receipt
To prove that my bars are a hundred grand large
My futures so bright you can see it in the dark
With the blindfold on the hindsight of a blind dude
Im not cocky Im just confident fucking raw
Before I knew what a condom is K. Lamar
Youre the one who gets my heart to race and my arms to sweat
Youre the one Id risk my life and waste it on a bet
Temptation sweet, I taste it
That casino waitress, drinks sedated
You the one I want, you the one I want, face it
You the one I want on a one-on-one basis
You can see my weakness, a week is not long enough
I need every season and this the only reason
You the one I want, you the one I want
Leave it all on the table even if they catch me cheatin
Doin blackjack, twenty-one, twenty thousand in it
Probably twenty more before Im done
If gamblings a sin, then Im rollin dice with Lucifer
To make sure I aint losin you
Thats what a craps shooter does, Im bankin on the win
Bankin on the last, vacant from the job that I had
Life savings in my pocket
If I never make it back, then I had the option of takin a risk
So before I slit my wrist, Im a cash in on this last poker chip
You can bet
Ooh, Vegas, baby, ooh, Vegas, baby
Ooh, Vegas, baby, I was scared of you
Ooh, Vegas, baby, youre Vegas, baby
Youre Vegas baby, I was scared of you
Youre the one whos got me drinkin wine until Im fallin down
Youre the one who keeps the slot machines spinnin around
Yeah, Los Angeles, Welcome to the Terrordome
City of Satan, angels cant even get along
No lie, my town covered in darkness
Hoping that the sun just shine on us
Rolling up the kush, now Im letting my mind wander
Into another place, I aint tryna go down under
Life is like a race and we all tryna finish it
Shit never fair, strays hitting the innocent
The good die young where Im from and its sad to say
That somebody gotta die today
Tomorrows never promised, but we living for the moment
Nigga, time never stops, it just keeps on going
Crackers just gave my young nigga four life sentences
Twenty-five times four, nigga, do the math
And the hood never have witnesses
Cause if we did, then them shots gon blast
As I reflect, I start realizing I wanna
Make a way one day for me and my momma, family and friends
This aint the way my life bout to end
So Im quick to grab on my pen and
Give em something my people sure to feel
Give em something that I know is all the way real
Just wakin up, mind playing tricks on me
Got the fifth on me, gotta take a risk homie
Was a ball player till the coach pissed on me
Keep it real, I could take you down the list homie
Be a tradition, see these Chucks be a mission
Burner be the fuel to the flame, the key to the ignition
If you banging, be serious, boys run up in your pad
Point-blank, period, moms aint hearing it
Niggas said cuz lil nigga got blasted
Oh well, give a shit, shouldnt half-assed it
Only time you with it, when your niggas all tripping
Caught your ass slipping, now Im stepping up my crip and steady dipping
Riding through the city in lights, living it trife
Wrong intersection, ready to fight
Hopping out with my own agenda, who the contender?
Better hope this motherfucker jam 
As I reflect, I start realizing I wanna
Make a way one day for me and my momma, family and friends
This aint the way my life bout to end
So Im quick to grab on my pen and
Give em something my people sure to feel
Give em something that I know is all the way real
Uh, as Im hearing the first and second verse
I try to analyse the feeling thats felt in the song
I want to tell Rock and Q to go to church
But thats a hypocrite because I aint been in so long
I stare at the world from a righteous point of view
And realize a crisis coming
Novocain couldnt numb it, the pain is unbearable times two
Lets rally a team, summon, and school the youth
How you feel about it?
Man, I feel the same way as you
It hurts my soul, like a needle piercing
Through the bottom of my shoe and if you behind bars
Hold your head, pause
And if you in close range with a nigga with a gun in his waist
I pray the intervention is divine
I got a cousin in jail and handful of homies in heaven
But earlier than expected, what the hell?
As I reflect, I start realizing I wanna
Make a way one day for me and my momma, family and friends
This aint the way my life bout to end
So Im quick to grab on my pen and
Give em something my people sure to feel
Give em something that I know is all the way real
When I jumped off the porch I was forced into last resorts of a temper gone short
And, of course, when that took its course, hoarse when yelling out
Demons that fought inside of me taught society how to rejoice
Killers on side of me, privacy obviously was lost
For a piracy of the streets and my Odyssey
Caught a bullet that probably destroyed...
A good kid in a mad city, slightly annoyed
I walk down the street with no heat and run into beef when I’m just a vegan
Reeking the scent of a saint, sinners smell it then start squeezing
Pellets tumbling straight at my melon, apparent reason...
Because my cousins cuzzin a Blood
That was Blooding in public and Kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin
But you aint no kin to me, probably Kendrick Im Kennedy
Assassinate my character, shoot as your remedy
Fair enough I got enemies but I don’t bang
But thats the repercussion like when your cousin’s cuzzin a blood
And you’re by yourself at the Compton parade
Good Kid
M.A.A.D City
Life or death
Is you with me?
Wassup
Poke your elbows out and swing like this
Poke your elbows out and swing like this 
Rock got it, Rock came from rock bottom
Now Im on top, pocket full of guacamole in it, no lie
The windows on the Continental tinted
Cocaine colored, its a dope ride
Them dope boys outside
Gangbangers, crack heads and hood rats
Drug paraphenelia inside that back pack
If you want it we got it, thats where them goods at
Nickerson Gardens, project parties
Chronic, Hennessey, dro, Bacardi
Guns, enemies that come through, spark them
Throw em in a dumpster; you loved one, you lost him
I dont dance I just boogie a lot
No dress code I just wear a hoodie a lot
White tee under that back against the wall
West coast rocking to the beat, now Im telling yall

Addicted to that sex, they be traveling in packs
They be off that X, and theyll let you fuck fast if you got some cess
I aint gon lie about it
I aint bullshitting, come to my block boy
Welcome to Hells kitchen, we bring that heat to you
Too much of a real nigga not to see through you
Wet him like faucet, bullet sink through you
They speed through you, they eat through you
Two lullaby burners, let em sing to you
The harmony of it is pleasure to your ears
You got to love it you got to hate it
I got to be my hometown favourite
Watts representer, say hello to your mayor
Everybody put them Ws in the air
May I show you the plan I lay out
My disc will never play out, I tell yall to
Poke your elbows out and swing like this
Poke your elbows out and swing like this 
Poke your elbows out and swing like this
Poke your elbows out and swing like this
Whatever you want to call it
For the weed heads or for the alcoholics
Now this can be some OG low-rider music
Or you could twist your fingers up and gangbang to it
Swing your elbows and Taylors, the shell-toes
Kush blunts all in the air, I smell lows
Compton swap meets to freaks on Melrose
This is California, killers on them corners
From Long Beach to Inglewood, Hollywood
Back down, them gangsters will be on you
Block hot as a sauna, uh
We in the club, zonin, Patronin
My knuckleheads roamin, they on and we on it
Its jerkin, poppin, brackin, whatever you want to call it

Mic check Ali
The mic dont sound right
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot 
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot
Uhh
Tell em I got plenty arson to sell em
Heat by the fleet displaying it very seldomly
I write till I ignite my cerebellum
Close to the pen like I had 3 felons
Come from a city where niggas show no remorse
And a corpse is just another hommy taking its course
Of course my dream was to play in the Final Four
Till the twelfth grade came and I was only 54
So now Im a graduate looking to get hired
My pops knew a security job he inquired
But ignorance is bliss, thats what I was told
I stopped, dropped and rolled when somebody yelled fired
Now there goes another black boy unemployed
With a lot of free time which means hes vulnerable to run into a lot of crime
I wrote it in my rhymes
And when I left the porch this is what I realized
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot 
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot 
These streets aint none to play with
It could get outrageous
Got burners, .45s and gauges
That could really get outrageous
So Im thinking to myself, whats next?
My security job only got me like 2 checks
My pops disappointed, told me Im fuckin up
Irresponsible and I need some growing up
I told him I would go back, knowing I wouldnt go back
Working a 9 to 5 is something I couldnt stomach
Surrounded by the violence
All the goons and the goblins
With 99 problems I still kept it 100
These streets can be rather manipulating
Especially when youre black and just turned 18
So whats a kid to do, when your fresh out of school and the negatives of the world constantly following you?
Not to mention a local henchman, copped a sheriffs part like terrorists
Osama with badges that talk arrogant
That boy 15 and he holdin a .45
30 years apart, 30 years before he realized
Uhh
Soon as the beat drop, I bet some heat pop
On a block close to you like a relative
You sippin Belvedere while these niggas plannin to rob Mr. Belvedere
Yeah Im a good kid tryna stay righteous as Martin Luther but it seems like all of my friends eventually become shooters
And niggas bangin on you is something that youll get used to
You can either fight back or run home and grab your ruger
Whatever you do just make sure youre willing to do it
Being too indecisive can get you killed inside your Buick
Cuz you stopped at the light, 5 minutes from midnight
With no tinted windows that nigga surely had shot through it
You tell me you listening, but you dont hear the music
Call you Billy Hoyle when turmoil was near
This is the realest right here
When I lost my very first job
My pops said why?
I said I couldnt aim for the sky
Cuz even shooters can get shot
These streets aint none to play with
It could get outrageous
Got burners, .45s and gauges
That could really get outrageous
The only way Ive been practicing my whole life is to be responsible for what I do. I dont know how to be responsible for what every black male did. I dont know. Yes I am gonna say that Im a thug, thats because I came from the gutter and Im still here
Im a mothafuckin thug, I hate payin taxes
Just hate it, Im tryna fuck a couple actresses
If I dont got it Ima make it
Still dont got it, Ima take it
Run that shit, take your shit, thats what I wont do
Out here doin what I want to
Nigga you do what you can
Thats the difference, Im a mothafuckin man
Im a man, nigga, and as a man I dont take that
I dont do Versace, thats that gay shit
Yeah I said it, Im a thug
Im a thug, nigga, guess I need a mothafuckin hug
Well dig my mama up and tell her give me one
Lotta niggas say theyre real, Im the realest one
Im the realest, this exactly how Im feelin, bruh
Aint no chillin, bruh
Im a mothafuckin thug
Im a mothafuckin thug
Im a mothafuckin thug
Im a mothafuckin thug
Im a mothafuckin thug
Its all about the Benjamins
Nigga, fuck George Zimmerman
How its pistol versus hand?
Take your whoopin like a mothafuckin man
Pussy, damn, how hard can a kid hit?
And why them local rappers aint did shit?
Lil Wayne said, Fuck the Heat
Same local rapper niggas wanted beef
Fun, brother versus brother
No hesitation when you face the same color
None, Im sayin what the fuck you niggas stand for?
Guess its lost in the South, Jim Crow
Still Im shootin in the gym
Thinkin back, shit I couldnt hit the rim
Nigga you should see my game now
If its a fully, nigga aim down
Let the gun work
Super clean but Ive done dirt
Talked the shit until my tongue hurt
And I dont run from skirmishes, nigga
Im a mothafuckin thug
Im a mothafuckin thug
Im a mothafuckin thug
Im a mothafuckin thug
Im a mothafuckin thug
Sometimes I look in the mirror and ask myself what Im scared of
How dare the media portray me this way, I can hear the
Crowd screaming, the weirdest of chants, they all in my ear-a
Artist of era, role model, I cant
Its like Im a parrot, apparently Im markin the dance
I seen done with the devil, such a ghetto romance
How many niggas fall victim, looking at you trapped in the system
Mentally they kept you in prison, and you wont get out, no one visit
Open up your mouth, no one listen, you in denial, nigga
Im in denial with you, I dial dead homies numbers off this liquor
Time and time again I find myself inside the cerebellum
Of several felons, Orions belt couldnt live in my world
I seen tigers, lions let loose and spooked, Im next door to Earl
I guess I rely on Jesus to save us before I refer
The madness, my neighbors witness ski masks
The masses dont know
Im packin this four and harassin your ho
Antagonizin the business you love the most
See the difference to my approach is a forty ounce at the store
If a forty bounce, to get low
I never learn, Im hard-headed
The corporate world dont like it, but I said it
Im a mothafuckin thug
Im a mothafuckin thug
Im a mothafuckin thug
Im a mothafuckin thug
Im a mothafuckin thug
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
God Orion lives in me
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
God Orion lives in me
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around
Compton Kendrick, something splendid
Yeah Im in this B-I-itch
No I.D., I be a G, exclude every other alphabet
Every time I D.I.P., I need all of my Ruffle chips
Duffle bag full of Frito Lay, itll be okay
Dont call OJ because Im on some killer shit
K Dot in his killer whip
K Dot with his killer dime broadcasted on Channel 9
Lay back, let my seat recline
Rolling like 2 miles per hour
I was with success, I dont know where yall were
You see its funny how I do this thing
Throw em in the pond cause these pawns wish they knew this king
Say they word is bond like Double 07s service team
They be head servicing, get off my dick
I lay it down so cold, you would swore that I was half Eskimo
In bucket seats below zero
Oh its me, Im showing out, I get it crackin
They never fill my void when Im absent
Every time I come through, through, through, through
They be on it so thirsty, thirsty
Hoes they be boppin so thirsty, thirsty
Haters they be watching so thirsty
Yeah, you too, too, too
You be on it so thirsty, thirsty
Hoes they be boppin so thirsty, thirsty
Haters they be watching so thirsty
Why you always acting funny
Aint never got no money
You say you dope, but yous a dummy
Lying to the hoes and your homies
About youre doing this and that
Saying always who ya with
Nigga, you thirsty
Nigga, yous a bitch, bitch, bitch
See all the time that you spending
Runnin round town, pillow talking and hating on me
You need to stop talking bout me
Cause your bitch want a guy like me
And you wanna be me, but you cant cant
And you aint, aint, aint
Man you niggas forever thirsty
Doing suicides in the desert in Albuquerque
Im a fundraiser for Kanye
Cause I got them good bars, but I aint selling Hersheys
Emperor like Xerces
Niggas say they players but aint never had a jersey
King James, Im a legend way before my thirties
Sent from the heavens, Im a reverend to you clergies
I swear I do you dirty
Covered in that purple got me feeling like Percy
Harvin, got these rappers starving at my mercy
No disrespect to Terrace Martin
But I run circles round these tracks like Kentucky Derby
You see me with a white bitch, you swear Im fucking Fergie
Putting money in a safe, look like Im stuffing a turkey
Plus the way that I be dressing got your girl down south
Like the state that I be repping
She slurps me, til Im dehydrated
Elated, blowing on this 3-5, faded
New clothes, you never see my Levis faded
Bitch Im buzzing like a bee hive, East Sides greatest
Now Im working with producers
That I never thought that I would work with in the future
Underground cause my verse is in the sewer
Thirsty ass niggas, theres beverages in the cooler
Loser!
La da da, the look of lust, yo, yo
Pleasure is a must
Im sleeping here with lust, scenes of ménages with Asian massages
Sin is the sin of my apartment
She can feel the rhythm as I give her my guitar licks
Mmm... She never knew I was an artist
I play the instrument well in a dark lit room
Please baby gal dont pause this groove
Ever seen a flower in a darkness bloom?
I know you never have, love
And we all got is lust, we dont have love
I think this song started in the bathtub
Then the melody continued to a back rub
You told me your homegirl can play the sax, love
Well show me if she can play my notes perfectly, youre making me a fan
In between your smiles were the sounds of our whispers
As Im looking down such a bountiful picture
I look at her, then look at you
And both of you make such a beautiful muse for this music
But this is not a Mozart movement, but baby girl keep your composure
Im not done with composing, its the look of lust
The look of lust is in your eyes
A look that you cant disguise
Say she hate it when Im super faded
Know that homie notice her body rather her conversation
Rushing, lusting sexual favors when the hours chasing
Midnight at 2 pm, a vampire in Jordan laces
Prey on the blood of the promiscuous
Panties on the premises, pantry full of condoms
Fuck your conscious, lets get intimate
She said, Baby boy slow down
You know I move with diligence
You think that Im a ho now and strip me from my innocence?
Hmm...She was older, she was colder than the rest of em
Lurking over my shoulder, temptation getting the best of her
So much... I never knew how to touch a real woman
Kendrick I want you to make me feel something.
Pulled down my pants and then she glanced at me with a smirk
Repeatedly shook my hand I said, Whats wrong should I kiss it first?
I can do that I wont complain
She said, That aint a problem Im wet
But first you gotta fuck my brain like a surgeon
Get your mental working
Like a 9 to 5, before we get it live and close the curtains.
I thought a massage was all I need
Now proceed if its worth it
Or leave if its urgent
For you to rendez-vous, I know your needs have a purpose
Cause I have feelings too
And you have feelings, but thats only in your teeth when theyre hurting
I started laughing
She pulled my card like pitty-pat
Pity the fool for any kitty-kat, its the look of lust
The look of lust is in your eyes
A look that you cant disguise
Oh the look of lust is saying so much more than words could ever say
Walking through the streets, I met a palm reader
She told me I was wise beyond my years
Says Ive been here before, well I guess that Im just here for more of the lust
Will she keep this on the hush? I like the ones that never blush
Uh-uh, yeah, now you seduced by the serpent
Wine on your lips, Im close enough to know that thats as fine as it gets
Im in too deep and Im diving for dinner
She lets me know that shes a synchronized swimmer
Blind-folded heckling, you cant see her
But Im guessing that shes got the look of lust
Uh-uh, yea
The look of lust is in your eyes
A look you cant disguise
Let your fears go and catch your blessings, yeah
Let them hoes know you dont do messy, yeah
Screensaver on because they dry snitch
Caption on your post saying You my bitch
Tell me that youre leery
Tell me you gon get in trouble
You dont want the city
You dont want em all to judge you
Ex-man said he caught a fair case
Young bull slid in for the Segway
I touch down, smokin dope on the daily
Come here lil baby, know youre birthday ready
Ill turn you out if you want, if you let me
Dont save face, dont save face

Sleepin on explosives, everything live
Ima get you open, one day at a time
Put that on God, man, I put that on God
Nobody pray for me
Even a day for me
Waaaaay 
I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a fella with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin this
Parmesan where my accountant lives; in fact, Im downin’ this
DUSSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, wont you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
Its levels to it, you and I know

Show me somethin natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mamas couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy

As my mind drift and then split
Like the middle of a spliff, I begin to catapult off
The cliff of the unknown
I got a feeling in my funny bone that were not the same
Just antonyms of another age
My soul flock with the carefree
Words of the wise, I spoke a hundred times like a gold D
Haha LMFAO
I hate yall but I spread love like mayo
Then spread slugs
My brain matter is a brain phantom
See my vision, or my visionll stare at ya
This is the future if I say so, you copping fitted caps
Im about to go and cop a halo
The God of rap and I mean it, and I play football with Mars
And marbles with Pluto and Venus
Witness the genius, I interact with the inner city villains
That enters your system like a computer hack
Then give you dap
Uh
Yeah
Kendrick Lamar
Uh
Yeah I can reconcile being depressed real bad
Im a thinker not a drinker but still I Hennessey drag;
Alcohol numbs the pain like where Novocaine stabs
In your arteries, pardon me but my city go mad
Via Compton California, corners with coroners and karma on em
Colours corresponding to gangs upon us
Common corrupted Crips and Pirus cripple the city
Triple the crime, Bible nor the Quran can save;
Welcome, dont be afraid, your city similar right?
Where the choppers kidnap the night and police silence your rights;
Stare at the sky, wonder will you live to see twenty-five?
Im twenty-two, at twenty I knew I was against the odds;
This kid named Jonathan was monitoring
His momma and sister, his older cousin, he honoured him;
Anonymous bodies on his burner was astonishing
To Johnny, he mightve been
A modern day rider then
He walking outside again, he see the lifestyle of an active member
Pull out a MAC-11 now his eyes is big
Fascinated by mayhem, whats his cousin to say now?
He wanna be from the hood that hes from and thats one
More gangster under the family tree, took em under his wings like KFC
Crip crazy, rocking matching T-shirts that says The hood made me
No love, just spread slugs, thats the policy, the leader and the prodigy;
Now shorty doo-wop, holding a oowop, hanging with rah-rahs
With blah-blahs that sit on the block catching fades hittin’ licks
Going on missions with lunatics, a ninth-grade menace
Thugging for six months, smoking like six blunts an hour;
The power of banging, he was walking from...
Little Johnny
I think youll find, sir, that there will come a time
When black people wake up and become intellectually independent enough
To think for themselves as other humans are intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
Then the black man will think like a black man and he will feel for other black people
And this new thinking and feeling will cause black people to stick together
And then at that point you will have a situation
Where when you attack one black man, you are attacking all black men
And this type of black thinking will cause all black people to stick together
And this type of thinking also will bring an end to the brutality inflicted upon black people by 
And it is the only thing that will bring an end to it
No federal court, state court or city court will bring an end to it
Its something that the black man has to bring an end to
When I jumped off the porch
I was forced into last resorts of a temper gone short
And, of course, when that took its course
I was hoarse from yelling out
Demons that fought inside of me taught society how to rejoice
The killers on sight of me, privacy obviously was lost
And the fraud piracy of the streets in my odyssey
Caught a bullet that probably destroyed
A good kid in a mad city, slightly annoyed
I walked down the street with no heat
And run into beef when Im just a vegan
Reekin’ the scent of a saint, sinner smell it then start squeezing
Pellets thats tumblin straight at my melon, apparent reason
Probably was because of my cousin cuzzin’ a blood
That was bloodin in public
And Kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin
But you aint no kin to me, stead of Kendrick, Im Kennedy
Assassinate my character, sure thats your remedy
Fair enough, I got enemies but I dont bang
But thats the repercussions like
When your cousin is cuzzin’ a blood
Then you’re by yourself at the Compton parade, he said:
Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang 
A gang member, Im active, I do my thing 
I do my stuff 
I’m really from the sect, tho 
And if you is or aint, I still need to know
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
I seen em from afar then I seen a piece of my jaw
Like on the ground, you know the sound
When you hear the people in awe
Sympathetic cause they like seeing you
Tryna fight back at a pack of piranhas
I promised three of ’em, beat the black off my back
And pajamas was almost needed
I shouldve went to sleep and seen some sheep
When I greeted the pavement
Got up and seen the shock on their faces
Like damn it, he made it
My luck in the palm of a cherry bomb
And they waitin to blow up on me
My homies are not alarmed
Then I heard someones firearm
Make a sound like it waved around my direction
Im guessing this is the part where my heart
Expected to drop in a second, look at the faults
Ive made in the shortest amount of time
And in back of my mind Im like this the loss Ima take
My fate was distraught
A cape and some superpowers cant save me
Im probably pushing up daisies
Before I can make my way to the car
Cross cancel and right before I seen
The black glove raisin the handle, he said:
Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang 
A gang member, Im active, I do my thing 
I do my stuff 
Im really from the sect, tho 
And if you is or aint, I still need to know
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Bitch, Im bustin back, Ima borrow my uncles strap in a minute
Jump in a Civic then wear that bitch on my lap
I was timid but now Im tempted
And tenants alert me on where you at
Im a menace when Im offended, relentless, I will react
Then somebody said the dispatch
Of an officer, got his mind made on offn ya
Thats a fact when youre black and undeveloped
Youre profiled as a felon
Im bailin down Boulevards with my basketball and a backpack
Gym shoes and my nap sack
Hair nappy, my ball cap backwards
And then I look back, strobe lights on my tail pipe
Turned left then I turned right
Turned deaf cause the sirens is loud
As the colors of pink and yellow on Wesley Snipes
Pray to God I dont get sniped
Pray to God that the sunlight stay shining for 30 more minutes
Hope that a witness around when Im bout to cut off the engine
Vengeance of hatred is what Im facin
Even though being a criminal aint my memo
But this is what he said when I dropped the window:
Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang
By the time you hear the next shot, youll learn that L.A.P.D. is the biggest gang 
I do my stuff 
Im really from the sect, tho 
And if you is or aint, I still need to know
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Ughh
Yeah
Kendrick Lamar
Ha ha haha HA
This feels like, right in front of the freeway
And when Im done this should be in front of a DJ
I watch whack rappers put their soul on Ebay
Then expect excellence knowing their effortless
I dont have a preference, I dislike all
Say you run the globe? Well more like a disco ball
I spread love as well
Little nigga, big dreams, can bear-hug a whale into a lobsters tail
Ugh
Evacuate premises, raps sinister suspicious
The pastor stand back, the bible is open, the words have been spoken
The moon and the stars align with the bars
The broads are snapping their bras in broad day
Cops meeting their quota running for arcades
The three initials on the pistols printed all Ks
The end is almost near, inferior of nothing
Superior is an option and my synopsis is that Im Frank Sinatra
On the roster, top running
Running races with my own shadow
Look in the mirror then I start to battle
Now a pyru is a crip, nor a pyrus just a value that is sure to be heard
Like a fuckin sheeps cattle, niggas got some nerve
Talkin bout they move birds
Only thing I move now is a noun and a verb
I am now on the verge of telling the real story
Of a Compton native in the city that kill for me
Cus you fabricated the realness
The county building and the county children on food stamps
Glorifying street cred, talkin about whoop whamp
But thats never the case
Just a good lawyer who can sever the case
Recording live from the city where the skinny niggas die and the semi bullets fly
Drinking Remy out bottle till the pain run dry
Like a desert
Once the Desert Eagle ride by, what you reppin?
What you reppin my nigga, you got a weapon?
Well I got a profession my nigga
Its called hip-hop since Pac was on gridlock
Me against the world every hour, every second my nigga
You want something, get something
I could start a career AND I can end one, Im H1N1
UGH
Straight-A student who flow stupid
Real raps get permanent income, UGH
Beats and bars
Kendrick Lamar
Maestro whattup?
Ha ha haha
Soul brotha, number after one
The brightest out the bunch, compare me to the sun
Skinny as a motherfucka, probably skipped lunch
Hungry with the same appetite as Big Pun
They say Im too much, I ask how come
Theres no one else with opposable thumbs with such a touch
You help a nigga once and hell probably forget it
You help a nigga twice, youre officially his crutch
I understood this back when I was just a young lad
Couple lies and a couple lines in my notepad
My composition wasnt even competition
Now Im dropping shit in the booth more than the pot I piss in
And might I mention
I dive in the pool of violent piranhas
You find another guy with my description
My prerogative is simply to annihilate you simply
I got fired from my job, but I gets busy
And I aint tryin to ask for more than I deserve
So understand when I say I need a million today
You blend in like chameleon
But I stand out, like I exited the building
Fuck yo feelings, Im just sayin, you aint nothin like Ab, nigga
Were night and day like Meek Mills and Mac Miller
Im sippin Remy watchin Martin droolin over Gina
If I had the opportunity Id turn her out, like Tina
But not like Ike, Id take a much different approach
Roll in a river til she hit them high notes
No disrespect, Im just a nut, tryin to get some cash
Yous another nigga in my way, tryin to get some scratch
Im tryin to get to San Tropez, or somewhere close to that
All cause I heard Jay say it in a fuckin rap
Now make that ass clap, I know this aint that type of song
But I get pussy too, they only like me for conscious songs
Whatever that means, I swear Im so aware
But I wear shades everyday, my vision gotta be impaired
Plus you would think they found me in Korea somewhere
And Im just another nigga, like Farrakhan with curly hair
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen would you believe me
Or see me to be just a angel thats easy to please
Angled a company by a gang of niggas that squeeze
Once their marks are your tire marks, thats the fuckin mark of the beast
I try so hard to follow God
You know, anointed oil, plant some Bibles in the front yard
Rebuke at the turmoil
My dreams of being like Jordan are spoiled
My temperature high that it boiled, til your homicide is good for you
Im loyal to my feelings, I try to stay righteous and cordial
But these feelings are twenty-twos a producer, new Zoo
These gorillas they let loose at 2:45 on 245 street
Colt 45 and shoot, walkin outside and slippin like Kenneth Coles
On a slab of grease, body found in a pothole
Forks, white tees just to cover up his long nose
And that bitchll hang to my knee like a dress
I confess Im depressed
I suppose Im more than likely infest my best in the Lima
Hop out, gun your ass down in front of your mama
I try to follow God like Bishop
But when they see that you bitcher, prepare for a ditch of
Dirt, I give you a list of families that hurt, but oh well, fuck it, thats life
And thats the color your son chose to put on tonight
So in self-respect, just know I say its a honor
Hop out, gunnin us down in front of your mama, uh
Like kindergartners my visions bothered
By vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
The starving, the speed on ya
Stampede on ya, impede on your pockets that peed on ya
Dreams of us livin lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spinnin, established with women, dinin and laughin
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash
Into society, take the drivers seat, hope youre fastened
Your seat belts twice when I rolled them dice, I crap
So many times I could build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
Thats what my mental say, but my physicals been detached
Im on some other shit, like fuck the government, Im higher rankings
Where the mothership? I made the covenant that I was changin
But my luck has been quite disgusting when reality tainted
Where the fuck you been? Left him face down like he was plankin
In a cold world where old girl and a home boy got a motive
You could bitch, girl your tribulations, that sensations insultin
Got a wifey or mistress, nigga which one you indulgin?
Regardless of who you pick
Know lifes a bitch when you aint focused, nigga
...and this is WTOP Radio and Im your host DJ Turn-Up
I dont turn down nuttin but my collar
I aint turnin down no money
And I aint turnin down no mothafuckin fade
Now bitch if youre pushin up the street with your orangutan-lookin ass, take some advice and bang SZA ya flat-foot bitch
Itchin for a climax lasting past 11:30
Do you got it like that, do you really got it like that?
Itchin for a purpose, I cant seem to scratch the surface
I aint got it like that, do I really got it like that?
You keep talkin bout time, I got none
You can find me where
The sun dont never end and the waves dont part
You dont pay enough of my rent, dont start
I got big dreams and you got quick scheme to get rich quickly
And I dont wanna waste another hour
Really need to take another shower
Dirty for you
Big business, big booty bitches, black on black Benzs
Backing out the back to back my engine, backpack with gats in it
Backflip my dollars and bend Impalas, my arm whistling
Palm flipping, middle finger, fuck yall, I let it linger
Plush wall and marble floor, ghetto Commodore singing
Tours for my whores swinging, on my heart swore
I pour plenty more semen, or explore cunnilingus
Dummy tore through that boy for pointing fingers
Honey youre a PS4, my game change seasons
And my name explain visas, I defame your name easy
We aim and keep squeezing, bitch my lane say no treason
My chains say no cubic, all yall look stupid 
Big dog, three phone call log stupid 
Im Chris Paul, West Coast, All-Star stupid!
The mantra, the holy trinity, baby your sponsor
My concert and your facility, via del Compton
And Watts finest!
Now this that big shell fishscale
BMX on the ramp with the fishtail
Pegs on the front, we gon get there
We four deep at a swap meet, dont need a 5th wheel
This bitch steal whoever if situations get real
This that fresh out the bounty, bustin knuckles
Get buckled if you ever try to knock the hustle
Show your hands, watch how I shuffle 
And show you why they hate more niggas than Uncle Ruckus
Rollin up that boondock, some call it moon rock
Gotta keep that bass in my step, dope in a tube sock
Gotta do what I do to remain on
So all a nigga need is good love when I come home
Cause the babys gotta eat, baby the rents been due lately
And I just caught a hot one, I aint tryna go too crazy
Fugazi, not me, me and my niggas not sweet
Give you thug passion, how you walkin around knock-kneed
Im the silver bullet movin at top speed
Show you how to get it and get away with it scott-free!
Ok now shorty had yellow
Shorty eyes brown
Shorty so gold
And so is my crown
Baby color me red
Shorty code red
And so is my flag
Purple in my bag
And shorty hair black

Mama says she love it when Im color coordinated
So I pull up in a maroon coupe with maroon laces
In my Supras I maneuver like
MacGyver when its time to ride
Say she always feeling blue
When he telling white lies
Rain on her window pain
All she see is grey skies
Told her hit this purple
Maybe this will ease your mind
Im rocking purple lable
Check out my shirt design
Perfect with her purple kisses
Slack track number eight
From The Dream maybe this is something you aint neva see
Put you in a real world
Take you out that green screen
Sippin on pink panties
In the stretched limousine
They takin off pink panties
When we hit the room please
Dont confuse me for no murderer like Norman Bates
But Im about to kill it
Pull out the yellow tape
Im guessing Im a criminal
You caught up in my web
Like a brown recluse
K. Dot is a color never seen boo
She love it when Im flamed up
Valet park the Red Lamborghini at the Grand Lux
Grammys with the red tux
She a red bone
Red manicure
Red hair
Think I like her
Might wife her in some red airs
Walk her up my red stairs
Headed to the red room
She gone yell code red once I jump in that womb
Red diamonds on my wrist, red diamonds on my neck
Give yo ass a blood bath, if you ever disrespect
Red lobster, you a small fish walking thru my set
Red beam, Im aiming from the roof of my projects

Eatin red beans, shittin on em, Where the flys at?

I do hoes like Stockton and Malone: make my pick then roll
The ugly ones go to Sam Cassell
You washed up like Nick Van Exel.
Shawn Kemp, Robert Parish, John Salley whole career on the bench

20 years later my style favor a kangaroo
Jumping off the ground im tapping the star spangle
Banner with manners over ignorant lost angels

Hammers will blast snap and hit you from every angle

Your making publicity stunts to make your name blow
Im dropping c4 every month to make my name blow
Drive a hoopty every month like its a range rove
Get in on the passenger side because the door broke
Take you on a natural high this is for sure dope
Watch you go be outside then give you more dope
Im gonna flood the streets outside go buy a raincoat
Open the door my tapes fall out your Durango
West coast till im gone and wearing a halo
Til then im ready for war lets play halo
Take down the fifth of Hennessy and watch the day go
Bye like farewell can somebody just pray for
Me like holiest priest on gods payroll
Tabernacle to all the Churchs chickens I ate on
Its K.Dot you motherfucker motherfucker mother blucka blucka bring a ruckus better duck em make you suffer quick suck a dick
Look, coming from gangbangers and palm trees
Eating on polly seed and bomb weed
In Wallabees, better yet, my Wallacees throwin up the set while Im chillin in the summer breeze
You niggas really want the gun to squeeze
And im shootin from nutting
Backseat with the window down ready for ducking
I aint riding shotgun unless I gotta shotgun fuck around and pop one leave your fuckin top done
Like the body shop on a mardi gras
Bad little bitch keep the gat in the party bra
You know Im ready to shoot you know I recruit give me the loot like Big Poppa who shot ya noodle niggas over cheese make pasta
Top dawg sit at the table we all mobster
Never passed english and grammar still proper

Like a stripper my nigga no homo
Take a puff of the swisher then get dozed
I do this for my niggas who is locked up in the prisons that cant get out of them systems theres no hope
So my mentality gotta be cut throat
Everytime that I spit it I provoke
Jay Rock for president go vote
Put them in a state of shock like a million votes

I got bundles of snow so come snope
Big bottles of henny who wanna toast
Big bags of green who wanna smoke

And when its show time ill take you to the Cinemax
Los Angeles on the fitted cap
Committed like Richard Pryor and getting stacks
Yo Punch they think that history is a joke read up on how they brought Woodstock to watch for black folks
California souls, you say the west aint unified like the LA school district you mustve missed it
Riding around my old junior high high, remaniscing I have the same goals now
But I never thought for a second I needed Snoop and Dre to help me out
No debit give me all of the credit
SOUL
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what’s the, what’s the, what’s the scenario 
Crept up in this muthafucka soundin like a stun gun
Fresh up out the hotbox got me smellin like marijuana

Everyone applaud, praise to the genius
Never would like to let the hoes bow to the penis
Feenish
Kendrick relentless in other words a dentist
I’m in they mouth without a doubt
It’s funky grab an incent
Grab a honkey, grab a nigga, grab a wetback, grab a chink
Then put ‘em in a box like Michael and Leon Spinks
Then tell me what you get for cultures feeling me
As if they was blind and braille on my sleeve
Peace, to hip-hop, down to earth
Word to the voice of Chris Rock
Can I rock like a 88 Camaro and T-Top
Whoa, the scenario seem to flip like an aerial
As I dip like a pull-up bar at the gym
Won’t you witness the gem
I’m a troop from Angola and
You a cop on patrol that’s trying to Axel Foley
As dumb as Napoleon Dynamite and I’m quick to blow up then BOOM
Combustible like flames and petroleum
It’s Jay Rock
Niggas know my status
Flip flows like a gymnast on a apparatus
Leave yo body in pain if I hit you with this ‘matic
Don’t even speak if you ain’t talkin cabbage
Loyal to the cash, thinkin’ ‘bout a marriage
Committed to the block that’s somethin’ niggas cherish
Hmm.. if you dissin’, you missing Parish
Then I’m on a mission, fishin Paris
Lookin’ at some dimes, go get your cameras
Black Hippy emcees and we got hammers
Gang member slash rap nigga
The name’s Rock, all the hoes call me that nigga
Never relax, never do that
Soon as you relax, them lames is stealin’ ya swag
I’m the truth in the booth I’m killin’ the track
To the point of no return no bringin’ It back
I’m so fluent on the beat just spittin’ the facts
You lames lyin, think you chief
You bridgin’ the gap
I’m the fountain of youth, you niggas is tap
Like bugs in the phone, you niggas is wack
Enter the mind of the utmost divine
Heel up reel up, bring it back come rewind
Twilight zone, war with the star
Hans Soulo
Top Dawg, not Todo, notch logo
On my hand, knock you out
Goddamn!
Say I’m not lethal, inhumane
Squeeze juice out a beetle
Offended John Lennon come to cloud 9
That’s where the cockpit is
Me and Kendrick Lamar startling all contenders
ScHoolboy Q, gangsta with a USC student IQ
And Jay Rock a fuckin’ fool
You make the wrong fuckin move
He like “DON’T FUCKIN’ MOVE!”
Aimin’ at you with the tool

Just a bit of a break from the norm
Cash rules everything around me:
CREAM, get the money
Dollar, dollar bill yall
 – “Mo Money Mo
Problems”]
I dont know what they want from me
Its like the more money we come across
The more problems we see

[Chris Brown – Look at Me Now (feat. Lil Wayne & Busta
Rhymes)]
Lets go

And Im feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I dont and I wont ever stop
Cause you know I gotta win everyday, day
Damn, damn
Compton
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today Im yelling
Bitch dont kill my vibe, bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe, bitch dont kill my vibe
I was running through the six with my
I was running through the six with my woe
I dont mess with you

Maybach bumper sticker reads: What would Hova do?
J is chillin, Jimmy is chillin

Baby, wont you come my way?
Got something I want to say
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti

Your mom busted in and said, “Whats that noise?
Its Justin and Jimmy singing Beastie Boys
You got to fight for your right to party
You got to fight for your right to party
Hey, everybody let me hear you say Parrrrrrty
Justin Timberlake, Jimmy Fallon
History of Hip-Hop 6
Lets start the show
Cloud nine, where you can find me and my dime
Like Roosevelt in his prime, wait till Im in my prime
The moon and the stars will align on my Louis V. belt like Orion
To whom say he cool
But the irony is I can hold the bottom of an iron
With the bottom of my palm
I say so much so little, all action, no talk
Like a mime throwin up gang signs
Its not all about punchlines, I dont do that
Im a jaguar, you just a new cat, now move back
Kendrick Lamar on the radar for success
Aimin for the top like an AR aimed at your neck
I can never digress ‘less I get demoted to death
Even then I’ll be the best still like a petty theft
I will conquer my biggest dreams
Once you open the cage, I bet that I’ll spread my wings
Nipsey got street cred, Jay Rock got street cred
And all I got is bad credit, big ears and big head
But still they’ll feel me cause we all ate cereal
Humped the momma friend daughter while they bump the stereo
Backflips on shoppin carts, free lunch at the park
Watched Power Rangers after school, here we go
I’m so Comptonized, I will never compromise
For no fussy-ass A&R or TEO
We aint what you think and you think we back
But we been here for decades and I vouch for that
Open your mouth for that
Speak well like a great debater over iChat
Get your other eye cracked
I don’t rap, I Iraq and declare war
I enjoy watchin enemies blood pour
I came up lower middle class, not poor
So don’t feel sorry for me, I don’t need y’all to love me
I need y’all to feel me
And if you feelin froggy to leap, then feel free
My feeling’s all aside, my pride is deprived
By the ultimate prize Im a get when I see your suicide
Too hot to handle, too dope to hold
Two dope boys, we roll deep, everybody gather your seats
We goin to cloud nine, we comin back in a week
And the weak good riddance
Only the strong permitted to ride and test drive
With Kendrick the Jedi
One of a kind like great antiques museums buy
Haters, I tell em, Hi, enemies, I dont tell em shit but puta

When youre not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin in the hotel room
Lucifer was all around me, so I kept running
Till I found my safe haven
I was trying to convince myself the stripes I got
Making myself realize what my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discriminationAy, on my momma nigga, Imma be the greatest to ever do this shit
On my momma though, like, on the dead homies
Ay, Sounwave, turn this shit up, nigga, turn this shit up
Sounwave, turn this shit up, nigga
Tell me who the bitch nigga hatin on me
Jumpin on my dick, but this dick aint free
To Pimp a Butterfly another classic CD
A ghetto lullaby for every one-day emcee
Nigga, now RIP you
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogyI remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin in the hotel room
I didnt wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin for answers
Im the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Im the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listenin sure you will agree
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, your friendship, I meant it
Im African-American, Im African
Im black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, you know that its big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me dont you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You know youre evil I want you to recognize that Im a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but cant take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
Im guardin my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin a killin
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real higga
As we proceed
To give you what you need
Trap our bodies but cant lock our minds
Everybody just stop
I said they treat me like a slave, cah me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah we black
And man a say they put me in a chain, cah we black
Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon me back
But now we have a big whip, parked pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that
As we proceed
To give you what you need
Lock our body, cant trap our mind
We gon be alright
We gon be alright
We gon be alright
We gon be alright
We gon be a-
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize youre lookin at me for the pay cut
But homicide be lookin at you from the face down
What Mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin, and let me tell you bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty women and women, and its the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows
20 of em in my Chevy, tell em all to come and get me
Everything I know, karma comin heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
Tell em other gangsters silence for the record
Tell the world I know its too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Wont you please believe when I say
Wouldnt you know
We been hurt, down before
When our pride was low
Lookin at the world, Where do we go?
Im at the preachers door
They wanna kill us dead, at the preachers door
We said give em some more
This one time, do it fo sho
But we gon be alright
We gon be alright
We gon be alright 
We gon be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon be alright 
We gon be alright 
We gon be alright
We gon be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon be alright
What you want, you a house, you a car?
Acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, Im your dog
You can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can smell it, I know its illegal
I dont think about it, I deposit every other zero
Diggin in my pocket, candy paint it on the Regal
Diggin in my pocket, aint a profit big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... ah!
I dont talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel
I dont talk about it, bout it, everyday I see
I dont talk about it, bout it, everyday I see
I dont talk about it, bout it, everyday I see
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, thats all
Pick back and chat, I trap the back for yall
I rap, Im black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write til Im right with...
God
Its been a week already
Feeling weak already
Got me at peak, possibility of what could be
Situation is heavy, Ive got to prove
On February twenty sixth I lost my life too
Its like Im here in a dark dream
Nightmare, hear screams recorded
Say that it sounds distorted but they know who it was
That was me yelling for help when he drowned in his blood
Why didnt he defend himself? Why couldnt he throw a punch?
And for our community do you know what this does?
Add to a trail of hatred
Twenty twelve was taped for the world to see
Set us back another four-hundred years
This is modern day slavery
The reason why Im by your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
Every piece of your brain
Til your son jumps into your arms
Cut off the engine then sped off in a Wraith
Im on the dash with my bible in the trunk
Had the vodka on the top
How come I can long time
How come I could make it popular?
Puff on what I want
How come I could make it popular?
Puff on what I want
See Im living with anxiety
Giving up sobriety
Cussing with his sister
And playing with society
Justice aint free
Therefore justice aint me
Try and justify staying, obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time, I go to church and talk to God
Now Im thinking to myself
Hollow tips is all I got
Now Im drinking by myself
At the end of Section Park
Caught you when you walk besides your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
Every piece of your brain
Til your son jumps into your arms
The engine then sped off in a wraith
I said Hiiipower, one time you see it
Hiiipower, two times, you see it
Hiiipower, two times, you see it
Conversation for the entire nation this is bigger than us
Yeah. How I sound out there Ali? Good? Then good
Can I pay my past a visit?
Centennial Compton School District
And video campus shut the fuck up your premises
King Drew and Westchester had the baddest bitches
And my nigga L Wood had a white Toyota, and we got pulled over
Had to hide the bottle because there was mix with Hennessy and soda
Every time we rode up we was unsober
And everybody had know that
My nigga Yan Yan had all the red P Hat
Which was really dumb because where we was at
Was the other side and more than likely
The other side really didnt like that
Didnt have no burner so if they shot us we could never really shoot back
Could of lost our life over hood rats
We was dumb as fuck but lucky for us we was lucky enough
That the black car didnt pull up and ask where yall niggas from
I know some, nigga less fortunate was fucking with the enemies bitch
She had a fat ass and a brown Camaro but it wasnt that fast it was like a V6
But anyways she was one of those hoes in highschool with the cornrows
Size 5 Jordans, Rolex sporting, and wanna fight everybody she knows
Well shes important, well she wasnt, she was just so and so so and so cousin
He was a red, so anytime she got into it, that who she would get
Now let me get back to the plan
Homie had ask,  Do ya got a man?
She said,No, he said, Oh yeah
Where do you stay? She said,  Rosecrans
Rosecrans and what? She said, Dont matter just know I fuck
He said, What? youre a, youre a little freaky bitch huh?
She said, Yeah daddy I can you get you sprung
I can work that pussy and the tongue
If you come over I can make you cum
If you come over make sure that you bring drink
Because I like to get to drunk.
And that he did, that Friday he was where she lived
Notice that he was out of bounds
But didnt give a fuck cause he wanted to fuck that bitch right now
Walked in the house, rubber on, panties down
Oldies playing in the background
Lets get it on Marvin Gaye had bumped to the morning
Time to go, picked his pants up off the floor
Kissed that bitch in the mouth then walked to the door
When he walked out he seen a four four Bluh!
Didnt know that was the pussy he was dealing with
And thats how you get your ass killed bitch!
Thats how you get your ass killed bitch!
Thats how you get your ass killed bitch!
Get your ass killed bitch! How?
Fucking with them hoes, them hoes, them hoes, them hoes
Them hoes hoes, them scandalous hoes
Them hoes hoes will have you uh dead dead dead
Look. I guess we all can learn from mistakes
But your first mistake, might be your death date
And death doesnt wait, on no one
A million ways to die, and you can make it a million and one
If you not aware of the rules or maybe tryna fill someone else shoes
Like a square trying to be a gangster kind of remind of this one dude
He wasnt thirteen he was twenty two
When he went to first get put on the hood
He wasnt born it, Boys in the Hood the movie made him think it was all good
But usually this type of person want to prove his s s s s self on purpose
Tell everybody quit working, but really hes worthless
His momma had money, his daddy had money, so he had money
The OGs that gave him a pistol, think that he was gonna be just another crash dummy
And the funny thing about it he thought he was bout it like P-Miller
But he wasnt no killa
Just a monkey hanging around a bunch of gorillas
Everybody wanna be tough guy so he did, approached this guy like, Where are you from? with his gun but didnt shoot it, rule number one
Never pull out if you dont use it
Even though the dude didnt banged the very next day he seen around the way blew his brains out while homeboy was cruising
Not knowing the scariest nigga will split your shit
And thats how he got his ass killed bitch!
Thats how he got his ass killed bitch!
Thats how he got his ass killed bitch!
Fuck around and get your ass killed bitch! How?
Not knowing the G codes, the codes the codes
The G codes, the codes the codes
The G codes, if you dont know then your already dead dead dead
Feel me?
Oh, hey
Winter with the raindrop
You can make the rain stop
You can make the pain stop
Heart pumping, novacaine
Speed through the motor lane
Race to your doorstep, feign for the short thing
Issue that I miss you, wanna kiss you on your neck, aye
Get you then I pin you to the post on your bed, ayy

Ive laughed and Ive cried
Ive lived and Ive died
Stole from, gambled and cheated
Cut corners outside
Ive tried and Ive failed
Stood tall when theyd run
Ive fought a cold war
In the dead of the hot sun
Now take me back to LA
Where the weather is good
Take me back to LA
Dont wanna give the road a second look
And I remember first time that I left
Pain, it flooded the wells of your eyes
You said youd never forgive me if I didnt make it back
But now Im comin home for some good lovin
Ive learned and Ive taught
Ive gained and Ive lost
Made due with what Im made of
Found out what love cost
Learned who I cant trust
Learned that its just us
Ive learned to love mine
Even when it aint much
Now take me back to LA
Where the weather is good
Take me back to LA
Dont wanna give the road a second look
And I remember first time that I left
Pain, it flooded the wells of your eyes
You said youd never forgive me if I didnt make it back
But now Im comin home for some good lovin
Take me back to LA
Take me back to LA
Take me back to LA, ooh
It was eye witnessing poverty
Burning bullets allowing these walls breaking
Devour these laws trying to empower me
I thought I knew the reason you grew to love sour diesel
Smoking like locomotive your focus was hourly
And then you caught me your pity party had towered me
Shower me with the will that never dried
I tell you put your worries and friendly doubts to the side
I doubt that you listen, it’s stuck in your system I tried
She’s been miserable, she’s been living in prison
Soaking up life’s reality this is the visual
Baby daddy a light build blade walking with highheel
Paid stalking that avenue, never knew how the light feel, I
Got a plan got a plan for ya
I just just might hold a couple bands for ya
And leave this message in the sand for ya
Tell me you’re ready to change
She said naw nigga it’s part of the game
Just like Heroin
Streets dont fail me now need you right on time
Say, right on time

Say, you right on time
Streets dont fail me now need you right on time
Say, you right on time
God, please lift the smile need you right on time
Say, right on time
Runaway from the fire, I fly downhill
Lay your head over this side, now
You keep pain on the inside, now
Whats been eating you, whos been needing you
You been keeping it down, and
You been taking me higher and higher
Functioning addict, I’m high off her passion
Chasing history’s baddest, I mastered this apparatus
Rackin my brain, Im scared of being average
Going against the grain just tryna maintain my savage
Foolish of her to try to play towards my vanity
And foolish of me to let her do it, I love calamity
I love a challenge, naw I love the fantasy
And this is high stakes I risk it all for a pair of snakes
Connect the dot nigga this is fate
Im talking predestination
Im talking blind dedication
Plan B is contraception we didn’t make it
Sexercise a little bit of patience
The love of the rush is us
Im addicted to violence, helicopters, and sirens
Blood pressure is skying, nigga Im trying
I never felt more alive than I felt dying
Heroin
Streets dont fail me now need you right on time
Say, right on time
Please stay paced and ground need you right on time
Say, you right on time
Streets dont fail me now need you right on time
Say, you right on time
God please lift the smile need you right on time
Say, right on time

Spacing out this bar so you niggas cloud climb on

Aka nothings in my way once I start b-b-bucking
Fuck up your function and your house party my lifes shortly about fortune and vice

And your autopsy and my posse came through properly right
Everyones watching me all right if youre not watching me like
Sent my big cousin a kite got my shit buzzing when there wasnt even a doorbell, a insect or light year in sight

Smoking dodo in your mama house
She get off work early, cussing at us, and kick us out
Popping wheelies on aqueducts in the summer
We stealing minibikes whistle when Gonzalez was coming
And I remember Shaniqua gave you the cold shoulder

Im laughing at you and praying that the choppers dont catch you (Never catch me, never
Never catch me, never
Never catch me, never)
We ditching third period just to fuck your school up

Cornrows with the zags in the middle
Platinum FUBU jeans, rubber bands wrapped around the denim
I remember...
I can feel when you around
You forever hold it down
I return the favor when Im on stages
In love and memory, no enemy could separate us
And so I gotta say this
How Im laughing, now Im crying, I miss you 
How I fought you, I hugged you, I remember 
I love it even if I get no bigger
Youre forever my dawg, my nigga
Im in this club thinking bout my boys
As I cry tears of joy like
Woo-woo-woo-woo
Woo-woo-woo-woo
Pushing foreigns, flying cars
Poppin trophies, by the mall
Bring back Derek, Stunna Deuce
Pat Dawg thats my cousin, love him too
Wishing I could reverse, us patrolling the turf
Tams burger for breakfast, chili fries on my shirt
Granny said go to church, how often did we listen?
Sunday school wasnt cool, lets be getting at bitches
Aw man, I got weight on my shoulder
Aw man, I got
Aw man, I got so many angels to feed
Look to the heavens, they depend on me
This personal, I hope you know my loyalty
Will always run deep

Put my candle in the street
Put my faith in where you at
Gone, but youre not forgotten
Chad, I promise Ill be back
Im saying
Im laughing, Im crying, I miss you

You cant change the world if you cant change yourself 
You can please the world, but not God himself 
You can have the world and still need some help 
You outlast the world, if your heart is real 
You cant change the world if you cant change yourself 
You can please the world, but not God himself 
You can have the world and still need some help 
You outlast the world, if your heart is real
Dont look at me goddammit!
Ayo Q, you want a piece of this?
City filled with this filthy air
Evil pump in my blood, how dare you to stare
Never felt fair, no room for a tear
Come on dump, dont give a fuck if the coast clear
Jacket cover the ratchet, pants hang to my calf
Burner over the ab, sendin shots under your jab
You really wanna diss me?
Believe it like Ripley when Im off the fifth of whiskey
Damaging my kidney, I wish a nigga tempt me
Then its all bad, leave his parents all sad
Cops with a mystery, murderin aint shit to me
This a killing symphony, my nigga, for real
I still keep the weapon concealed, body will spill
Hollow tips stuck in your grill, give a fuck how you feel
Tired of resisting this murder addiction
Fuck a conviction, bust shots, slaughter conviction
Lucifer soul, my temperature cold
Eyes blood shot, throwin up blood clots, body in shock
I need me a doc, but I figure Im too sick
Fuck it, adrenaline pumping may lead in to something
Assumption on life is still, livin a trife
Asthmatic causing havoc, keep spazzin til my brain get damaged
Still remain most scandalous, that bang hammers
Fuck surveillance, shit, murk in front of cameras
Dump em in the sand like tan or big blands
More grammar shit, Im the illest motherfucker
Verse 2: 
Splash blocks like Dikembe when I sensai, who wanna shoot?
The liquor hear me, Im off the Remy like Papoose
I got the truths of a thousand bishops
Troops of a thousand niggas, you can get your ass missing
Like a white bitch with big tits to be specific
Im over they heads when the words get pledged
Fright night, gun tucked tight like a newborn
Dance with the Devil, hopefully you get your groove on
When I blaze this metal
Like a rolling stone, flesh and bones come out
Like a thug reunion, watch yall dumb out
Most likely, half of you fraudulent niggas dont like me
Scared to fight me even if you had hands just like me
K Dot, bare arms like a haltertop
Live from the barbershop, who want a fade?
Who want war? I got a drawer full of hand grenades
Take it back to them Contra days, so fall back
Its real, off cognac, and pills, we twist caps then peel
Bananas with the hammers, play if you will
A bullet proof for a shield, that wont work
I got big big very big big bullets, and they hurt
Lift up your skirt if you play pussy, dont push me, Im light
You pushing up daisies, if the pump do a push up tonight
I put, I put a new price on your head, like a mannequin dressed well
Students from Harvard can hear the nigga Yale
Im cold hearted, oh well
I gets retarded, the yellow bus Im a park it
In front of your house, hop out, gun in ya mouth 
Duck shows in your peek hole, me and my Hoover crip
But all I bang is your bitch, dont get me twist
Lets do this, Im ludicrous, disturbing the peace
Pacing back and forth like a stewardess, its plain to see
Da Evils
If you gotta go out, thats how you go out!
That motherfucker took his destiny in his own hands!
A drizzly Sunday morning in Compton, the sky an un-California-ish gray. Into the parking lot of a local hamburger stand pulls a chromed-out black Mercedes SUV, driven by 27-year-old Kendrick Lamar, arguably the most talented rapper of his generation. there are a half-dozen guys from the neighborhood waiting to meet him: L, Turtle, G-Weed. I grew up with all these cats, Lamar says. He nods to Mingo, a Compton-born sweetheart who is roughly the size of the truck he arrived in: I dont need to hire a bodyguard. Look how fucking big he is! The burger joint, Tams, sits at the corner of Rosecrans and Central, a famous local spot recently made infamous when Suge Knight allegedly ran over two men with his truck in the parking lot, killing one of them. Homey died right here, G-Weed says, pointing to a dark spot on the asphalt. That security camera caught everything. Theyre building a case.
Lamar grew up just six blocks from here, in a little blue three-bedroom house at 1612 137th St. Across the street is the Louisiana Fried Chicken where he used to get the three-piece meal with fries and lemonade; over there is the Rite Aid where he walked to buy milk for his little brothers. Tams was another hangout. This is where I seen my second murder, actually. he says. Eight years old, walking home from McNair Elementary. Dude was in the drive-thru ordering his food, and homey ran up, boom boom - smoked him. He saw his first murder at age five, a teenage drug dealer gunned down outside Lamars apartment building. After that, he says, you just get numb to it.
Its almost noon, but Lamar is just starting his day - having spent a late night in the studio scrambling to finish his new album, To Pimp a Butterfly, which has to be done in five days. Hes dressed casually in a gray hoodie, maroon sweatpants, and white socks with black slides, but recognizable enough that an old lady in line decides to tease him while complaining about the heat inside. Yall need to put the air conditioner on, she calls to the manager. Kendrick Lamar is here!
Lamar may be a two-time Grammy winner with a platinum debut executive-produced by Dr. Dre, and with fans from Kanye West to Taylor Swift. But here at Tams, hes also Kendrick Duckworth, Paula and Kennys son. Inside, a middle-aged woman who just left church comes up and gives him a hug, and he buys lunch for a cart-toting lady he knows used to be a harmless crack addict. Outside, an old man in a motorized wheelchair scoots over to introduce himself. He says he moved here in 1951, when Compton was still majority-white. Back in the day, we had the baddest cars in L.A., he says. I just wanted you to know where you came from. Its a hell of a neighborhood.
On his breakthrough album, 2012s good kid, m.A.A.d City, Lamar made his name by chronicling this neighborhood, vividly evoking a specific place and a specific time . It was a concept album about adolescence, told with cinematic precision through the eyes of someone young enough to recall every detail 
Lamars parents moved here from Chicago in 1984, three years before Kendrick was born. His dad, Kenny Duckworth, was reportedly running with a South Side street gang called the Gangster Disciples, so his mom, Paula Oliver, issued an ultimatum. She said, I cant fuck with you if you aint trying to better yourself, Lamar recounts. We cant be in the streets forever. They stuffed their clothes in two black garbage bags and boarded a train to California with $500. They were going to go to San Bernardino, Lamar says. But my Auntie Tina was in Compton. She got em a hotel until they got on their feet, and my mom got a job at McDonalds. For the first couple of years, they slept in their car or motels, or in the park when it was hot enough. Eventually, they saved enough money to get their first apartment, and thats when they had me.
Lamar has a lot of good memories of Compton as a kid: riding bikes, doing back flips off friends roofs, sneaking into the living room during his parents house parties. Then theres one of his earliest memories - the afternoon of April 29th, 1992, the first day of the South Central riots
Kendrick was four. I remember riding with my pops down Bullis Road, and looking out the window and seeing motherfuckers just running, he says. I can see smoke. We stop, and my pops goes into the AutoZone and comes out rolling four tires. I know he didnt buy them. Im like, Whats going on? 
Then we get to the house, Lamar continues, and him and my uncles are like, We fixing to get this, we fixing to get that, we fixing to get all this shit! Im thinking theyre robbing. Theres some real mayhem going on in L.A. Then, as time progresses, Im watching the news, hearing about Rodney King and all this, I said to my mom, So the police beat up a black man, and now everybodys mad? Ok. I get it now.
Weve been sitting on the patio a while when Lamar sees someone he knows at the bus stop. Matt Jeezy! What up, bro? Matt Jeezy nods. Thats my boy, Lamar says. Hes part of the inner circle. Lamar has a few friends like this, guys hes known all his life. But often hed rather be by himself
He was always a loner, Kendricks mom says. Lamar agrees: I was always in the corner of the room watching. He has two little brothers and one younger sister, but until he was seven, he was an only child. He was so precocious his parents nicknamed him Man-Man. I grew up fast as fuck, he says. My moms used to walk me home from school - we didnt have no car - and wed talk from the county building to the welfare office. He would ask me questions about Section 8 and the Housing Authority, so Id explain it to him, his mom says. I was keeping it real.
The Duckworths survived on welfare and food stamps, and Paula did hair for $20 a head. His dad had a job at KFC, but at a certain point, says Lamar, I realized his work schedule wasnt really adding up. It wasnt until later that he suspected Kenny was probably making money off the streets. They wanted to keep me innocent, Lamar says now. I love them for that. To this day, he and his dad have never discussed it. I dont know what type of demons he has, Lamar says, but I dont wanna bring them shits up. 
Theres a famous story from Tom Pettys childhood in which a 10-year-old Tom sees Elvis shooting a movie near his hometown in Florida, takes on look at the white Cadillac and the girls, and decides to become a rock star on the spot. Lamar has a similar story - only for him its sitting on his dads shoulders outside the Compton Swap Meet, age eight, watching Dr. Dre and 2Pac shoot a video for California Love. I want to say they were in a white Bentley, Lamar says. These motorcycle cops trying to conduct traffic but one almost scraped the car, and Pac stood up on the passenger seat, like, Yo, what the fuck! He laughs. Yelling at the police, just like on his motherfucking songs. He gave us what we wanted.
Being a rapper was far from preordained for Lamar. As late as middle school, he had a noticeable stutter. Just certain words, he says. It came when I was excited or in trouble. He loved basketball - he was short, but quick - and dreamed of making it to the NBA. But in seventh grade, an English teacher named Mr. Inge turned him on to poetry - rhymes, metaphors, double-entendres - and Lamar fell in love. You could put all your feelings down on a sheet of paper, and theyd make sense to you, he says. I liked that.
At home, Lamar started writing non-stop. We used to wonder what he was doing with all that paper, his dad says. I thought he was doing homework! I didnt know he was writing lyrics. I had never heard him say profanity before, says his mom. Then I found his little rap lyrics, and it was all Eff you. D-i-c-k. Im like, Oh, my God! Kendricks a cusser!
An A student, Lamar flirted with the idea of going to college. I could have went. I should have went. But by the time he was in high school, he was running with a bad crowd. This is the crew he raps about on good kid, m.A.A.d City - the ones doing robberies, home invasions, running from the cops
Once his mom found a bloody hospital gown, from a trip he took to the ER with one of his little homeys who got smoked. Another time she found him curled up crying in the front yard. She thought he was sad because his grandmother had just died: I didnt know somebody had shot at him. One night, the police knocked on their door and said he was involved in an incident in their neighborhood, and his parents, in a bout of tough love, kicked him out for two days. And thats a scary thing, Lamar says, because you might not come back.
After a couple of hours, the mood on Rosecrans starts to shift. An ambulance roars by, sirens blaring. In the middle of the street, a homeless man is shouting at passing cars. Lamar starts to grow uneasy, his eyes glancing at the corners. I ask if everythings OK. Its the temperature, he says. Its uh, raising a little bit. A few minutes later, one of his friends - whos been cruising back and forth on his bicycle all afternoon, patrolling the perimeter - calls out, Rollers! and a few seconds later, two L.A. County sherrif cruisers round the corner. There they go, Lamar says, as they hit their lights and take off
As a teenager, the majority of my interactions with police were not good, Lamar says. There were a few good ones who were actually protecting the community. But then you have ones from the Valley. They never met me in their life, but since Im a kid in basketball shorts and a white T-shirt, they wanna slam me on the hood of the car. Sixteen years old, he says, nodding toward the street. Right there by that bus stop. Even if hes not a good kid, that dont give you the right to slam a minor on the ground, or pull a pistol on him.
Lamar says hes had police pull guns on him on two occasions. The first was when he was 17, cruising around Compton with his friend Moose. He says a cop spotted their flashy green Camaro and pulled them over, and when Moose couldnt find his license fast enough, the cop pulled a gun. He literally put the beam on my boys head, Lamar recalls. I remember driving off in a silence, feeling violated, and him being so angry a tear dropped from his eye. The story of the second time is murkier: Lamar wont say what he and his friends were up to, only that a cop drew his gun and they ran. We was in the wrong, he admits. But we just kids. Its not worth pulling your gun out over. Especially when we running away.
Friends of his werent so lucky. Just after midnight on June 13th, 2007, officers from the LAPDs Southeast Division responded to a domestic-violence call on East 120th Street, about five minutes from Lamars house. There, they found his good friend D.T. allegedly holding a 10-inch knife. According to police, D.T. charged, and an officer opened fire, killing him. It never really quite added up, Lamar says. But heres the crazy thing. Normally when we find out somebody got killed, the first thing we say is Who did it? Where we gotta go? Its a gang altercation. But this time it was the police - the biggest gang in California. Youll never win against them.
On an otherwise positive song called Hiiipower, from his 2011 mixtape Section.80, Lamar rapped, I got my finger on the motherfucking pistol/Aim it at a pig, Charlottes Web is going to miss you. Its an unsettling line, especially coming from a rapper who often subverts gangster tropes but rarely trafficks in them. I was angry, he says. To be someone with a good heart, and to still be harassed as a kid...it took a toll on me. Soon youre just saying, Fuck everything. That line was me getting those frustrations out. And Im glad I could get them out with a pen and a paper.
About three years ago, Lamar was flipping through the channels on his tour bus when he saw on the news a report that a 16-year old named Trayvon Martin had been shot to death in a Florida subdivision. It just put a whole new anger inside me, Lamar says. It made me remember how I felt. Being harassed, my partners being killed. He grabbed a pen and started writing, and within an hour, he had rough verses for a new song, The Blacker the Berry:Coming from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big
My nose is round and wide
You hate me, dont you?
You hate my people
Your plan is to terminate my culture...But as soon as Lamar wrote, he also started thinking about his own time in the streets and all the wrong Ive done. So he started writing a new verse, in which he turned the microscope on himself. How can he criticize America for killing young black men, he asks, when young black men are often just as good at it? As the songs narrator put it, Why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street/When gangbanging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?/Hypocrite
When it was finally released last month, the song sparked a rash of think pieces, with some listeners saying Lamar was ignoring the real problem: the systemic racism that created the conditions for black-on-black crime in the first place. Coupled with a recent Billboard interview in which Lamar seemed to suggest that some of the responsibility for preventing killings like that of Michael Brown lay with black people themselves, some fans thought he sounded like a right-wing apologist. The rapper Azealia Banks called his comments the dumbest shit Ive ever heard a black man say.
Lamar says hes not an idiot. I know the history, he says. Im not talking about that. Im talking from a personal standpoint. Im talking about gangbanging
He grew up surrounded by gangs. Some of his close friends were West Side Pirus, a local Blood affiliate, and his mom says her brothers were Compton Crips. One of his uncles did a 15-year stretch for robbery, and another is locked up now for the same; his Uncle Tony, meanwhile, was shot in the head at a burger stand when kendrick was a boy. But Lamar says he was taught that change starts from within. My moms always told me: How long you gonna play the victim? he says. I can say Im mad and I hate everything, but nothing really changes until I change myself. So no matter how much bullshit weve been through as a community, Im strong enough to say fuck that, and acknowledge myself and my own struggles.
When Lamar released the new albums first single, i, last September, many fans werent sure what to make of it. A blast of pop positivity that samples an Isley Brothers hit recently heard soundtracking a Swiffer commercial, it felt like an odd move for Lamar, whos known for more complex fare. People called it corny, mocked its feel-good, Happy-style chorus . I know people might think that means Im conceited or something, Lamar says. No. It means Im depressed.
Lamar is sitting in the Santa Monica recording studio where he made much of his new album, dressed in a charcoal sweatsuit and Reeboks. His baseball cap is pulled low over his sprouting braids, and he speaks softly and thoughtfully, with long pauses between sentences
Ive woken up in the morning and felt like shit, he says. Feeling guilty. Feeling angry. Feeling regretful. As a kid from Compton, you can get all the success in the world and still question your worth.
Lamar says he intended i as a Keep Ya Head Up-style message for his friends in the penitentiary. But he also wrote it for himself, to ward off dark thoughts. My partner Jason Estrada told me, If you dont attack it, it will attack you, Lamar says. If you sit around moping, feeling sad and stagnant, its gonna eat you alive. I had to make that record. Its a reminder. It makes me feel good.
Lamar also points out that the fans who scratched their heads at i had yet to hear u - its counterpoint on the album. i is the answer to u, he says. The latter is four and a half minutes of devastating honesty, with Lamar almost sopping over a discordant beat, berating himself about his lack of confidence and calling himself a fucking failure. Its the sound of a man staring into the mirror and hating what he sees, punctuated by a self-aware hook: Loving you is complicated.
That was one of the hardest songs I had to write, he says. Theres some very dark moments in there. All my insecurities and selfishness and letdowns. That shit is depressing as a motherfucker. But it helps, though, he says. It helps.
Lamar has documented his inner struggles before, most notably on Swimming Pools, from good kid, which explores his past troubles with alcohol and his familys history of addiction. But once he got successful, he says, things got more difficult, not less. One of his biggest issues was self esteem - accepting that he deserved to be where he was. And some of that came from his discomfort around white people
Im going to be 100 percent real with you, Lamar says. In all my days of schooling, from preschool all the way up to 12th grade, there was not one white person in my class. Literally zero. Before he started touring, he had barely left Compton; when he finally did, the culture shock threw him. Imagine only discovering that when youre 25, Lamar says. Youre around people you dont know how to communicate with. You dont speak the same lingo. It brings confusion and insecurity. Questioning how did I get here, what am I doing? That was a cycle I had to break quick. But at the same time, youre excited, because youre in a different environment. The world keeps going outside the neighborhood.
The week good kid was released, Lamar began keeping a diary. It really came from the conversations I had with Dre, he says. Hearing him tell stories about all these moments, and how it went by like that - he snaps. I didnt want to forget how I was feeling when my album dropped, or when I went back to Compton.
Lamar ended up filling multiple notebooks. Theres a lot of weird shit in there, he says. Lot of drawings, visuals. Where as good kid was an exercise in millennial nostalgia, To Pimp a Butterfly is firmly in the present. Its his take on what it means to be young and black in America today - and more specifically, what it means to be Kendrick Lamar, navigating success, expectation and his own self-doubt
Musically, the album - at least the half that hes comfortable sharing so far - is adventurous, borrowing from free jazz and 1970s funk. Lamar says he listened to a lot of Miles Davis and Parliament. His producer Mark Sounwave Spears, whos known Lamar since he was 16, says, Every producer Ive ever met was sending me stuff - but there was a one-in-a-million chance you could send us a beat that actually fit what we were doing. Ali says Lamar works synesthetically - He talks in colors all the time: Make it sound purple. Make it sound light green.
But of all the albums colors, the most prominent is black. There are allusions to the entire sweep of African-American history, from the dispora to the cotton fields to the Harlem renaissance to Obama. Mortal Man name-checks leaders from Mandela to MLK all the way back to moses. On King Kunta, a stomping blast of James Brown funk, he imagines himself as the titular slave from Roots, shouting the punchline Everybody wanna cut the legs off him!/Black man taking no losses!
Hanging over it all, of course, are the tragedies of the past three years: Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice. Says Sounwave, To me, the album is perfect for right now. If the world was happy, maybe wed give you a happy album. But right now, we are not happy.
Lamar - who calls the album fearful, honest and unapologetic - is coy about what the title means. Just putting the word pimp next to butterfly... he says, then laughs. Its a trip. Thats something that will be a phrase forever. Itll be taught in college courses - I truly believe that. I ask if hes the pimp or the butterfly, and he just smiles. I could be both, he says
On the last day of February, Lamar and two dozen loved ones are gathered at a $6 million mansion in Calabasas, for a surprise birthday party for Sounwave. The estate belongs to Top Dawg Tiffeth, part of a group of properties so exclusive theyre protected by two security gates, the second presumably to keep out the riff-raff inhabiting the mansions inside the first. NBA star Paul Pierce lives across the street, and multiple Kardashians live around the block. Theres probably a million dollars in this driveway, says Lamars tour manager, a friendly dude named retOne, as he surveys the Audis, Benzes and Range Rovers out front
Lamar lives down the coast with his longtime girlfriend, Whitney , in a tri-level condo he rents in the South Bay, on the water. He still hasnt splurged on much: So far his biggest purchase is a relatively modest house in the suburbs east of L.A., which he bought for his parents more than a year ago. Top Dawg says that at first his mom didnt want to take it, because it meant giving up their Section 8 status. Kendrick had to reassure her: Its OK, Mom. Were good. 
In the kitchen, the girls are snacking and chatting, while the guys are in the home theater watching the new Kobe documentary. In the dining room, Lamar is talking to Sounwave and his manager Dave Free, trying to make last-minute changes to the record thats due out in two weeks
Eventually, Whitney comes in and rests her hand on Lamars shoulder. Theyre about the blow out the candles, she says. Everyone moves into the kitchen to sing Happy Birthday to Sounwave, and Lamar stands beside Whitney, his arm around her waist. They look happy. Sounwave is about to blow out the candles when someone tells him to make a wish - but before he can, Lamar jumps in and makes one for him. I wish, he says, smiling, for hot beats!

On the response to the line I’m the king of New York:
It made me go back here and feel like I probably gotta dumb down my lyrics nowadays, for people to take it way out of context the way they did… The main heads that really understood the context of the line was the actual kings of New York, the cats that I sat down with this past week. They’re not understanding that it’s not about the culture, it’s not about what side we on, it’s about being great as Biggie, as Pac, the two cats that I referenced… I feel like I’m a student. I’m a student of the work that they did. When I put down 20 years in the game, I can eventually plant my foot and have that same type of legacy… I never take the history behind what Pac laid or what BIG laid.
On Kendrick’s king of rap, Snoop Dogg:
To keep it 100 with you, Snoop will always be number one, and I’m from the West Coast, and he gave me that. But out of respect for my big homie, I understand it. He laid down. I only got one album out homie. One album out. I got years to be doing this. At the end of the day, Snoop will always be my big homie and the legends that came before me they will always stand tall where they’re at. But I can’t stop myself from wanting to be great just like them.
On East/West rivalry in 2013:
I feel as though you have certain cats that are really gonna take it to the next level and make it a rivalry thing and try to bring back that whole thing. No that’s old school homie. We black men out here trying to uplift the culture. My first sold out show was in New York…I respect the legends in the game. I respect people that done it before me, people that lost their lives over this. Because of what they laid down, I’m gonna try to go ten times harder and breathe it and live it. That’s the point of the whole verse, what I was trying to convey through that verse. All the ignorance behind it, you can kill that noise. It’ll never be like that again, two coast rivalry. Not on my behalf.
Its over, its really over
Kobe really retired, its crazy!
Its just a trip to even be doing this right now
Kobe really retiring
Call in marks, Kendrick take one
What can I say?
I mean really, what can we say?
Day by day, season by season, twenty, to be exact
Growing up watching him paint murals
Using this building as his first studio
Using L.A. as his canvas
Restoring crowns back to where they belong
Under royal banners, purple and gold
The color of royalty
My one man L.A. king
Back to Kobe, fallaway pull up
Oh! What a way to finish!
Kobe
Never meaningless could never mean less
Thats what he means at this moment
All season has been his goodbye
Him to us, us to him, to the whole world
Still got magic, but he made it magical
From Compton to Crenshaw
Jack to Jeanie
We were all witnesses
To all things that was him
I mean, we shared with him the world
Kobe, inside the three point arc...
Kobe Bryant has hit a shot at the buzzer!
WOO!
Soon enough, he became our identity
If you wasnt born and raised here
Or never lived here
You probably would never understand
Im-a make sure you do
Im talking about the 81 points
Im talking about the afro
Im talking about the alleyoop to Shaq
The off-glass buzzer beater over D-Wade
The game four overtime takeover in the Finals
Kobe
Im talking about the posterizing of Steve Nash
Im talking about Dwight Howards rookie year when he got baptized
You remember that
Kobe bodied him
The helicopter
The five parades
Kobe
The mashed-up gamut of emotions with you and with ourselves is so deep
I dont think nobody can break that bond
So I ask, how do empires last when theres no longer an emperor?
I mean, we got you
But at the same time, we got you
Im talking about your blood, your sweat, your tears
Even your DNA is placed in these L.A. concretes, man
And nothing would ever replace that or erase that
Forever great in our hearts
So with that being said
Know that its never goodbye
Its simply respect due
Our due, forever
Kobe
Got the ghetto in my heart every time that I spit it
Walk it like I talk it, this is how Im living
Still on the block, dwelling with my niggas
We dont got no job, selling dope be our business
Lord be my witness, trying to get a million
Flushing everything if they run inside my building
Niggas steady snitching
Bitches steady riffing
Raffing, until I start clapping, Im itching
Im so Cal
Cals under my white tee when I walk out
Niggas be hating, I dont trust smiles
Me and Ransom representing the same struggle
In the gutter its all about money and muscle
Feds dont want to see us free
They got us under surveillance like TMZ, yeah
Its Jay Rock, I be these streets
I promise to keep it real til I D-I-E, yeah
I was on the block, ducking, running from cops
On the corner slanging the rock 
Now Im on top, pulling up in the drop
Saying peace to hip-hop 
I struggled way before I got on
So I gotta put my struggle in song 
Came a long way, Im here to stay
We all came from the gutter
Say we ball free, living by the name of my brother
Put the cane in the cubbard
Childhood scars from the pain that we suffered
Mom dukes always tried to raise us above it
Pop dukes always tried to claim that he loved us
Now we blaming each other
Got my brain from my mother
You cant judge a book by the grain of its cover
Or the name, or the color
I sold drugs to my nigga Pop
So you know the devils on my side when I hit the block
So you shouldnt be surprised when I get the guap
Flip the rock, watch the water bubble when it hit the pot
A fiend died last night, time to switch the tops
If you dont know what time it is you better fix your clock
Now were not even surprised when the pistol pop
We dont even move, know the rules never snitch to cops
I just spent my whole life trying to make it out
Dreaming of a check, in a Lex, throwing paper out
Theyre trying to break the house
Got to go the safest route
Not a blind date, but these apes trying to take me out
I used to be a nobody from the projects
Now my projects got me flyer than a cockpit
I used to cop bricks, loading up Glock clips
Now Im in the drop picks, talking about stock tips
Okay, maybe Im exaggerating
I aint filthy rich, but I got imagination
Its my year to eat and I got a platter waiting
Sharks in the water, I sort of got them salivating
Im living a life considered a price
My past years couldve had me up in prison for life
I am the, tip of the ice, division of christ
This duffle bag red nigga, just admit it Im nice
One shot kill, one shot kill hey
One shot kill, hey, one shot kill
One shot kill go!
I say, thinkin of a master plan
Motherfucker, Im a mastermind
Im an 18-year-old dollar sign

Penitentiary blade to cut yo ass up
Good-lookin hunk
Lookin for anybody thats lookin for me
Shotty look em right in the eye

A scared nigga, I even got you a suit and tie
Something suitable
Sledge hammer break down your nail cuticles
Nigga, I do the unusual
Torture
Anything is necessary in the art of war
Slam his head inside the suicidal doors
Do him like lil man off Players Club
Roll around till his knees rub

Im done with regular bowel movements
Im on some other shit
Im a fuckin beast, you a fuckin bitch
Ima fuck your bitch
Then send her back to you
Let her suck some dick, then let her kiss on you
Now, aint that a bitch?
That aint right, but that’s my life
If you don’t like then we gon’ fight
Psyche—you gon’ be fightin a bullet
Where the pump at?
Thinkin of a master plan
Mothafucker, Im a mastermind
Im a 18-year-old dollar sign
Im a one-man tragedy, Im Columbine
Shit, you already know what Im about
Keep the guns by the couch in the living room
Company act up, we give it to them
Send it to them like emails
Let them sell his soul
Put his body on retail
If we do dirt and you tell
We gon’ put you under dirt
He was a good person
He was down to earth but now he down to earth
Chillin with the worms and the insects, his brother gon’ be next
His mother gon’ be after him, kill the family tree
If they fuckin with him and that him is me
And that limb is lost on your body
Aiming at your feet, probably
Training day
Sniper music
Sniper music
One shot kill
I told you before
One shot kill
I told you before
One shot kill
I told you before
One shot kill
One shot kill
One shot kill
Im the coolest nigga you know
Migrated from the North Pole when I was fo
Infatuated with cartoons and G.I. Joes
Till something more greater took a toll: life
Not really, more like white Air Nikes
Evidently, I had a fondness for material things
Ten years old trynna get a 10-K ring
I forgot it was for me when the phone ringed
Elementary girls callin the house
Desiree and Cheryl mama end hustled what we talkin about
Im talkin about the good old days when we walked without knowing that could be our last time walking out
Now we cant walk witout protection
Bein on the defensive, life ills
This life will put you in a crazy world
Just by knowing crime will never cure
So Im strapped like Girbaud jeans
Id rather see the pen like I was bowling
Rather than death, walkin on heavy steps
Its a great place, but I aint ready for Heaven yet
So I told God put me at the back of the line
Matter fact yesterday, swear to God I aint lyin
Movin at a turtle pace, cause the fast lane got a day one uncle with one in the brain
Got one in the chamber
Sixteen in the clip, my eyes fluttered with anger
Hip-hop trynna save my life
Give credit whenever its due, the money touchin the roof
Breakin the ceiling, with that being Im breakin the loot
With my loved ones, life way too short, son
Shoul is, gotta wake up
Like a bakery, Im trynna get the cake up
Never know when the day come, so we live carefree
Party like its 1999, cherry cherry breath that I breath
Materialistic things, it wont mean shit when you leave
I aint lyin, a nigga miss the good old days
Sippin Kool-Aid, Mama let the OJs play
Nowadays, it seems like the end is near
Cause babies killin babies like Brenda did
Use ya head, mess around lose ya wig
Age fifteen, shit, a nigga witnessed it
Walking home from school, just me and my team
Shots fired, I guess it wasnt meant for me
So I thank the man in the skies above for his blessings until a nigga rise above
Im fly as a dog, more dope than a drug
On the microphone, lemme kick the verse for yall
Hip-hopll never die as long as we alive
Top Dawg E-N-T, haters dont even try
You dont wanna pay the price of a lyrical ass-whoopin, well let it fly
Watch your career go up in flames, let it fry
Watch it die, no get back, just sit back, enjoy the ride
Live like its no tomorrow, enjoy life
Im still reflectin on the death of
Mission of the better
Only one thats necessary for Sarah
See, yall can say whatever, but still it come together
I used to rip it down and let you sew it back together
Hip-hop forever, fuck em and whoever fed up
And I wish a hex on whoever met em
Im obsessed with objection
And Id probably blame Common for my resurrection
I used to love her too
So when Im in the booth, we do what lovers do
But I aint stingy, let my niggas get a piece of her too
Another piece and Im through
Probably trynna peace up with you
Niggas got some believin to do
It starts now
What would my name be? It gotta be something slick, man. It gotta be something, something real slick. Hardbody. Theres really no uniform. Thats the catch. It’s whatever the environment he’s in, he chameleons into that environment. No mask, no nothing. You dont see him coming. The powers that he project is straight love. Energy. This right here controls how everybody move and how everybody thinking. You live in a world full of hate. You feel me? The homies right here hating on you, they finna rob you. They finna do this, boom, he gon come in there. Chameleon. And you think he with you and your crew, but he working on the act of love. Yall powered up and dap out and move out to the next spot. You going to a spot full of discrimination. He blending in there too. You know? He might got a suit on. You feel me? But he acting on the work of love. And what that does is, his energy builds up to the next man and builds up all the way around the world and everybody is just full of this superb energy. Everybody getting money. Happy. Living and enjoying their lives. And not hating on the next man. Thats what he do. He might pull up in a Pinto, you feel? Or a two-door Honda or something like that. You know? Or if he in a prestige spot he might pull up in a Beamer, whatever the case is. His whole thing is about reality of it, you know, and not putting the cape on. You know? Cause he something different than a superhero. The archenemy villain, thats easy. I dont know if I wanna say a woman or a man, but I name her Lucy. Matter of fact, we gon put it to a stone, we gon disguise Lucy as a woman. In actuality its Lucifer, its a man though. Shes seductive, she seduces everybody. She comes into a room and walk out. You think you feeling the love, but once you walk out its nothing but negative tension around. You feel me? Yeah, Hardbody. Yeah, we gon do that.
Reporting live from where reporters die
Newscasters coming too early witnessing homocides
Pearly gates forming in the sky as we wait for your suit and tie
I tailor-made it for you then told Khalifa he loves you
Im really stuck on this bumpy ride
Highway to hell less I flip through a demons TV-guide
An angel said he seen me fry
Ducking bullets
I promise I couldnt stop the work my niggas have put in
Your brains is banana pudding
Im looking for trouble, looking for hustle
Im a grinder, choppas in the path finder
I aint no killa, I aint no drug dealer
Im a real nigga with real emotions that stand behind a
Brick wall, you knock it down then Im forced to align ya
With the stars of Venus and Jupiter
You aint aint gangsta, you fooling us
The government dont know what to do with us
Internal affairs investigate while LAPD speculate
Crooked cops on my bumper dumping til Im first 48
I can smell a snake a mile away because they reek hate
But any anaconda can die on a weekday
Wikipedia speeding up my career like Ive been here
And I dont fuck with these fuck rappers cause they been weird
Been on my dick, get addicted to dying quick
Grab a dictionary, my styles vary, my words flip
Grab a cemetery and jump in it you jive turkey
Watching me through goggles, I throw hollows at James Worthy
Spin your head like an owl, Im wild, I drive Fergies
Thats that white thing, let my nuts & Mic hang
No one ever knows the drama that I might bring
Chilling with the drama king, but this aint Broadway, mane
Armed forces, more fortune, alarm Porsches
Bitch gorgeous, bomb head like Civil War and
Yall snorin, we tourin and bottle pourin
Model scorin, cheat the game with fair warnings
Living filthy to get it, fuck writing lyrics
High status in traffic
Bad energy, getting static
Day and night like Gladys, Kid Cudi
Man on the moon, feeling managed like fuck a planet
Gon with it, ashing ashes on critics
Twenty racks then we split it up, feeling like a million bucks
Bust hoes, run into sluts, keep it G, that shit a must
Creeping in that Honda Civ, aint mine, it aint his
Written down, spare the kids, back to the crib ya handle biz
Lunchables and sandwiches, dude dog be mad as shit
Visualize the shit I kick, never heard of witnesses
Better make sure Im innocent, 18 shots at 3 niggas
6 a piece, hell of a life, done for the night, throw up they Nikes
? precise, for the cheese they call us mice, no rats
Everywhere is a trap, talking bout that white girl
Feeling good to be black, ya whole hood I seize that
Breaking down the , fuck all that feedback
Gone by the morning, I landed soon as you yawning
Feeling like Im Conan, here to fuck up your whole program
Who can fuck with us, no man, Hiiipower slow dance
Kick a funky toe jam, gold rapper, thats trojan
Slinging rock erosion, and yo bitch be open
Easily I be chosen, comparing me Im like who them
Back to back tracks, running laps
With dictionary words on top of verbs to prove that they wack
Pressing weight to the max
Hurt your man like swinging ax, release it let em chat
Man amongst boys but these toys arent his racks
Itunes that shittin stacks, shitting stacks while writing raps, rap!
Looking humble, let them react
Too many bars, not tit for tat, super hits like having bats
Swinging for the fences, in the trenches making a difference
Driven like a engine, directing me through my fucking mission
West coast, east side, my stomping ground, come around
Get your ass flatlined from niggas of that cracklines
Welcome to this wildlife, steady living a wild life
Trying to beat all competitors and predators, they proud knights
Nightfall; lay low. Sunrise; so live
Better watch your front-end, your back better have four eyes
So high: satellite, smoking on that bomb, nigga
Dynamite, you acting like a pussy, you no friend of mines
Better yet, fuck friends, surrounded by my real niggas
They cock back, they see caps, they peal quicker, real killers
Real business, its never personal, Jack, remember that
Fuck up my money then Imma fuck over your universe
Im shooting first, never last, gotta stay sharp like shattered glass
In a fast lane with a bad dame, man, this bitch from Trinidad
Fuck her hard, then send her home, its time to start my routine
In the streets, with the heat, you dont rhyme, you dont eat
Pockets fat like obese, its hard to be so lowkey
Niggas acting like they know me, fuck around and be the police
Trust no nigga nor a bitch
Nigga, Im so OG like 8 tracks and tape decks
25, but Im straight fed
Got a old soul, Im so throwed, so raw with this rap thing
Kay Slay, go tell em dawg, niggas know Im crack, mane
Kill em with my flow, everytime its a deathblow
You fuck rappers stay on your toe, we sharks in the water
Get that ass ate up, straight up, the worlds ours
Top Dawg ENT, HiiiPower
We buy flowers then we send em to your studio
Cause everytime we in that bitch, homie, its a funeral
I have to slow it down so you can hear me close
Yeah, Im nice with the bars
Late night sliding pipe in your broad
Her pussy tighter than them skinnies on the jerk dancers
Send her back with no panties
Jay motherfucking Rock
Uh, I see everybody wanna play gansta now, huh
Well you know what niggas
Imma just play Kendrick
You gotta respect it
Feel this
Uh, lemme shit on these niggas man
Look homie Im not your crip or your blood
Homie Im just Kendrick
See me other than him might plead the fifth amendment
Hard headed nigga shit all it take is an instant
Shocked to have scored just as soft as an infant
Say you bust your gun, but never totin it
You say your man is dope I think hes smoking it homie
Why you provoking it dont mean to boast a bit
But you can call me a fly cause your boy be on some shit
Pussy fly so all the girlies think Im the shit
Ive got it to spend but still never buy them shit
You better guard your bitch
‘Cause all it takes is a finger to turn her on holmes
Something like a lightswitch
Hands down but still dark think I might switch the Jag for the Porsche
‘Cause it got a better steering grip
Young but been a man and you wont understand
Spree wheels looking like a bed room ceiling fan
When the beef start cooking
And the shots start coming
Dont hesitate to pop that thing
People start looking
And people start running
Dont hesitate to pop that thing
Rolling down Rosecrans
I fear no man
I be God damned
If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet
That hub city threat shit is me
 Im from the land where fiends fly like Peter Pan
And the average man got a heat up in his dickie pants
I got some plans, to stack riches
Own 76′s like a Philadelphian
You dont know but now Im focused like camera lens
And if I know your mans I might give a second chance
‘Cause I dont wanna hurt you
Have ‘em running in herzels
Shells stick to his back like a ninja turtle
Crack sells, drug sell all in the virtue
Been an artist since Prince played in Color Purple
Weed smoke hydro blow on that purple
2 straps on my side like suspenders on Urkel
I suspend they murk you, what you lying for?
You know you aint eating like feed the children commercials
Man my children circle around your block
Let out shots and be home 30 minutes before they curfew
When the beef start cooking
And the shots start coming
Dont hesitate to pop that thing
People start looking
And people start running
Dont hesitate to pop that thing
Rolling down Rosecrans
I fear no man
I be God damned
If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet
That hub city threat shit is me
Its real
Kendrick
See me in the streets man
Come to me as a man, man
Its real nigga
Kendrick
You gotta respect it
Niggas respect me man 
Stop being some yank nigga
Its real
Lotta niggas tryna play gangsta, huh
Its 2004 man
You up in this shit quit it
Be yourself man
Still affiliated
Niggas respect me, bitch
In the thunder and rain
You stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand
Moving up my thigh
Skirt around my waist
Wall against my face
I can feel your lips
I recognize your fragrance, hold up
You aint never gotta say shit
And I know your taste is
A little bit, mmm high maintenance
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you the flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems and this song’s dedicated to you
Anytime, you can get it, you can get it
Any place
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty option plain
Cold nights when you curse this thang
You called up your girl when caught up in the ity bity rain
Heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Don’t approach her with that atari
That a good game always sorry
They say conversation ruination
I can tell
But I can’t right my wrongs
Unless I write em down for real, alright
Anytime, you can get it, you can get it
Any place
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
I really know you play this
‘Cus oh boy you test my patience
With all these subjective photographs
And all these one life vacations
Love is not a verb, you should look it in a mirror
Love is not a verb, if you’re lookin for a maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
Fatal attraction is called, what we have in common is pain
Anytime, you can get it, you can get it
Any place
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
Full time grinder. Watts City rhymer
The ghetto Moses tryna get my homies outta bondage
Need some time to think so Im rolling up the ganja
Sneaking out my pores, know Im blowing on the bombest
Bars looking nice, my rap smoke polish
A God on the mic, wack rappers pay homage
Leader of the new school
Everytime I bust a rhyme, incredible lines
When I talk, make em press rewind
I do it for Hip-Hop, fuck what you heard
Do it for my niggas who voices will never be heard
Listen, blessed with talent, voice of the young people
Went from a zero, now my city label me as a hero
Nine, double-O, five, nine, thats where the chopper sing
Sound so melodic, the problems, thats what the drama brings
Dog Im gutted as ever strivin for finer things
One-O-Five Eastbound, swervin in and out of lanes
This game filled with a lot of lames
On the real my nigga, this shit gotta change
From Cali to Queens, Top Dawg guarantee
We the new regime
I dont do it for them cars and the fancy drops
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
And I dont it for the chains and the flashin rocks
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
Like, 4 years ago
I was writing rhymes in my Chevy Celebrity
Spittin the hardness, says Doc Elery
Its prophecy I shine, ask cashanova
Burnin up my notepad tryna ash my doja
Sober...
For the game you decayed I sow it up
You must say yes too much
Cause you dont know enough
To match my caliber, Im a whole new breed
Ya staminas shot, Im movin like the old .23
For Hiphop I breath...
Have a seat, Im a beast
And Im ready for war with no peace
Seems that they forgot to rap, you had to think
They just wanna be ballers when you see em on the screen
Who am I to say the grass aint green
Who am I to say the next generation dont share the same vision as we
I will say this, its less likely
Than me having clean piss
Rest in peace
Omar Jones
Your spirits in my lyrics when I flow
Became the number one prospect
All because I keep it true, I dont do it for the coupe
Draped in stone like I gazed at Medusa
Download my audio and blow up your computers
Spit that conglomerate shit, the shit that you arent used to
Shit so strong the unborn can smell it in the future
Theyll sell it and they’ll shoot ya
A Mom and Pop store sold out
And the fan killed the clerk over my music
Is that real?
Realer than me at 16, writing sixteens, battled and dismantled six teens
All for the love of hip-hop, I would still rap
Even if Rodman came back and my diss flopped
Thats an analogy built with substance
Fuck an award, my metaphors for the public
You forging your signature on the great great K.Dot
I gotta catapult you, bye bye
I wake up in the morning then compose a bar
Flow reckless like the first time you driven a car
Perfected, from years of dedication
Wrote my first 50 songs and then I graduated
With my bachelors
And if you hearing this verse, I probably got my masters
And by the end of this verse Im your favorite rapper
Coming from where the diplomas dont matter
Backpacks still carry the work
Big burner under the shirt
Shit I just wanted her purse
Kill a bitch and hit the studio to murder a verse
Im just getting it in
Reminiscing about the time when I was stressing to rhyme
Started getting better, shit Im destined to shine
Clip load up
Fuck it back to the crime
Profession of pro skaters couldnt fuck with my grind
Still stuck with a nine
Shooting like MJ in his prime
You motherfuckers know what it is
Straight splatter your wig
Let your mother know its personal
And murder your kids
Little nieces buried in anchovies
Rap Lebron, Kobe
Hip-hop, shit, no matter what Im talking
Cough on the beat and its abortion
Murder motherfuckers, straight extortion
Live on the beat
Who wanna compete?
Down in Miami spitting heat, straight tragic
Move to Orlando working magic
Cocaine balls out the cabinet
Uncut, raw, whole ransom
Anybody can get it, Im fully committed to Hip-Hop
Uh-huh, yeah
You know what it is
Its that Compton shit, nigga
Get back
If I gotta ride
Then yous gonna die
I hope niggas aint really tryin to break my bones
Cause if you are make sure you know a nickname you want for that tombstone
Play hard as a rock bullets can break stones
Break bad boys down like Jenny did Sean Combs
Im hot as an oven, you just a pressin comb
Im not impressed homes you shouldve stayed home
And prayed that rooftop blocked you from gettin shitted on
I gives a fuck if A&Rs dont pick up the phone
I swear theres no one like me but if there is then I gotta long lost twin or they made me a clone
I dont care about friends, I was made to be on my own
I came in this world by myself and Im leavin alone
Hopefully with a crib that I can call my own
With a backyard the size of the fuckin Georgia Dome
Pop you popped shit and I might pop your dome
Give your homies a reason to make a memory song
Niggas swear that they love when the beef is on
Knowin that plummet time the only time hell roam
You better hold your breath, I give you workin death
And recommend the gun be your chaperone
I know young niggas that look up to Al Capone
And they look 17 but I swear that their mind is grown, shit
Im so grown and the reason why I write this way
Pac and Big be ghostwritin my songs
You can play the boss but if you get shot
From bein on top then, homie, thats your loss, shit
Im nice wit it
Ill pop your man then leave some money on him so it can pay for his funeral costs, get it?
The niggas tryin to get money like Fort Knox
Either from the rap shit or back down to the cut rock
And you can play a baller but deep inside you know you just an actor
Yeah, somethin like Rick Fox
You aint a thug, homie, you just a fox
In the midst of werewolves somewhere in the boondocks
And Im really from the streets
So if I ask for beef, homeboy, dont bring me no pork chop
I turn your skin to pork, homie, with one chop
With a rusty switchblade thats dirty like bum socks, heh
They say the flow is crack
So wherever I rap best believe you can call it a dope spot, bitch
 Im gon ride 
And this gotta cut 
Came from shit, nigga
Life in the city, life in the city
Oakland, California, Compton, California
But we survive
Only the strongest survive
Life, life in the city
In the city and niggas tryna survive
Only the strongest survive
You ever been a victim of being a prisoner inside your own mind?
The bright lights of the street lights will make you go blind
Handicap your senses, you was just an apprentice of watching niggas jump fences
Now you in the Olympics and your hurdle was high enough to clear the tallest of clothes lines
Talented when they closing in on your behind
Life of a young delinquent, even stole him a Lincoln
At fifteen, middle fingers walked out the precinct
I mean the cycle just continue
The vital information and fine print on the menu
So youll never read it even if a nigga lend you
Money out my own pocket, to make it right
Youll still attend to
Be on them corners with stop signs and a nine
Cause nine times out of ten, MAC 11s cry
And twelve died yesterday and if anyone divides
The six that carried you eventually lose they lives
True story
When the night falls anything can happen
We just pray we make it out alive
We all wanna make it to the top one day
Success is a street only going one way
But we all wont make it
Just try your best to survive
Well, follow me across the train tracks
Where angry and insane Blacks
They slang crack
Candles burn where they were slain at
And bottles get poured where they would hang at
Close, I give you truth in this essence
Dead homies added to swears when truth is in question
Like Man I think he lying or he put that on someone
If I known you ten years, got the right to say we cousins
Im from the city of broken homes, and often I was home alone
And momma started smoking cause daddy was scared to smoke alone
Section 8 policies, Top Ramen and sunflower seeds
June got killt cause he aint wanna lose his Wallabys
Constant atrocities, no one is safe
Theres no religion that can save you, say goodbye to your faith
Whether you Muslim or a Christian, Baptist, Jewish or Adventist, Atheist or non-religious
Put survival on your wishlist
Cuz
When the night falls anything can happen
We just pray we make it out alive
We all wanna make it to the top one day
Success is a street only going one way
But we all wont make it
Just try your best to survive
You walked in the apartment and saw your father on the carpet
With a belt wrapped around his arm and a scarf under his armpit
And a needle shoved in his bicep
Earlier this morning you warned him
His addict habits are something you couldnt digest
You cry saying I just dont wanna see you die
Now you tryna dissect the fact that he hasnt opened his eyes yet
You collapsed on his body and you started thinking
I could perform CPR, jump start his heart if its beating
But his pulse started to weaken
His cardio region depleting as you given him part of your breathing
He dead and gone and you had a bad feeling when you was heading home
Now its etched in stone, youve been left alone
So you grabbed his chrome gun, handle all pearl, aw nah girl
Put it to your head, thinking, fuck everybody like a call girl in a small world
Then pulled back but it didnt clap
Damn
When the night falls anything can happen
We just pray we make it out alive
We all wanna make it to the top one day
Success is a street only going one way
But we all wont make it
Just try your best to survive
Uh, can you bring the waiter back over here again?
Shes kinda cute
Eh, whats your name?
Say baby can we dip?
So, so I can swing you by my way
Hey, we lovers on the hip
Well, well I guess Ill be born that way
Say, thats why we skinny dip
To, a cabin in my hide away
Girl, oh
Girl, we’re lovers at heart, baby
So, I tip her, I tip her a few 
Our waitress is 
I tip her, I tip her a few 
Our waitress is 
I tip her, I tip her a few 
Our waitress is 
I tip her, I tip her a few 
This waitress is 
I still want your number though
Please
Roses bloom, so girl why are you
Blue, baby let me take you, show you, could it be?
If its cool, when its cool
My hide out, baby come and run away with me
And lay low
San Pedro, wheres my coupe?
Sugar, let me kiss you crazy, massage your feet
Girl its cool, girl its cool
We lay out, baby come and run away with me
Lock you up, find the key
To these adventures baby come around and see
Past the stars, through the trees
To a better living, baby come and grab a seat
Um, so when you available?
Never? Oh, okay, alright, okay bye, bye
I hope that didnt hurt you too bad
C4, K.Dot, lets get it
Yeah, Punch wanted me to come right in on the one
I didnt want to
I love this beat
I love it so much, I can just listen to the instrumental
And dont rap
But I wont do that
Light an incense for little Kendrick, little, oh, Kendrick
Determination, my drive is like a thousand convertible engines
My adrenaline pump the blood of a warrior, chump, the apprentice
Grown to be a man, 21 now, my heart in my hand
Don’t get gunned down, I’m from Compton, bitch
Fuck a 6-4, we hit the kill switch
The other day I seen my nigga Snows in the casket
Darker skin tone, you can only imagine
The type of shit we on, murdered them dumb bastards
Kill em inside their kitchen
And then stuffed them inside their cabinets
Death before dishonor, put that on my mama
Imma ride till I see the promise land, that’s a promise
Llamas in the unfamiliar minivan
More drama only make more problems, but
They gotta get shot down
Cause we riding, we riding, we riding
They gotta get shot down
Cause we riding, we riding
Like a black rodeo, .44’s, calicos
Chop em up, stop em up like a stuffy nose
We supposed to be brothers, motherfuck ya
Tuck your tail, bitch, hell is waiting on ya
While I’m praying on ya
Not on my knees though, I mean preying on ya
I gotta feed, ho, and your death is nutritious to my appetite
After I eat, you’re sure to see afterlife
Jesus Christ, forgive me for my sins
Because when you forgive me, I’m sure to sin again
I guess I’m a sinner, especially when I found out somebody killed my nigga
Nigga, does anybody killer, fuck your creed, race, or color
Son, daughter, sister, mother, brother gotta suffer
Bitch, I’m cold hearted, till my arteries freeze
Please hand me the keys to the G-ride
They outside then
They gotta get shot down
Cause we riding, we riding, we riding
They gotta get shot down
Cause we riding, we riding
Somebody get ready for a murder
No more further announcements
Mac-11 bouncing, the murder scene, coroner, yellow tape surrounding
Either I retaliate or find self counseling
Somebody got to die, simple mathematics
Semi-automatic, watch them niggas panic and their hearts perish
Or lets be diplomatic and less melodramatic
Everything is vanity, think Ecclesiastic
But what’s it all for, or what’s it all mean?
An eye for an eye means you and I won’t live to see
As our hearts bleed, we proceed cautiously
Shoot them niggas down consciously, that’s how
They gotta get shot down
Cause we riding, we riding, we riding
They gotta get shot down
Cause we riding, we riding
Rare Breed, Kendrick Lamar
Breed up or speed up
Breed up or speed up
Breed up or speed up
This is for my niggas that be all blacked out
Hit the streets a hundred deep, what Rare Breed about?
Riding hard, bending corners, the girlies on us
Leave a hater scarred, big Dressers sit at the stop light
Road Glides and Road Kings deep in my hindsight
You do it right or dont do it at all
Put that candy paint on it, ride them twenty-threes homie
Custom seats, custom brakes, hit the streets and ball
Centre of attention like Bynum and GasolYou know that killer californication
When you feeling like you sitting on a ceiling, chasing
Dreams, hoping this conglomerate can run the nation
Its abomination how we bomb yo block
Im talking Big Punch, K-Dub, Baby Slip Billy
Bad Azz, Rare Breed, we all we got
See em out, show em love, chunk the deuce, give it up
Its a lot of bike clubs but they not this hard, nope
Pounding on the highway stretch
All blacked out, making sure we on deck
Might catch us on them Dressers or them Road Glides, yes
Tell the world Im a Rare Breed baby
Breed up or speed up 
Breed up or speed up 
Breed up or speed up, Im a Rare Breed baby
And its like that to the death though
Two-oh-point and seeing decimals, I aint lying
Pounding on the interstate in the state that shines
Or we might be in a hood near you
Around the globe baby, Rare Breed under control baby
Them pipes loud, the movement entice crowds
We heat it up in the cold baby
Its three degrees out? Then you should see me out
Or see bout them kitty cats and how they go meow
Ha-ha, we be the father of Harley drivers, so dont bother
Show you infants how to whip it, have a bye-bye
Posers try to hang? Then we hang em by the collar
Silk, lannie, Rare Breed family
Stunting hard like a black circus, voila
Breed up or speed up, get ahead
So with that said, bye-bye
Shouting out the one and only Rare Breed
Now Breed up!
Come on
Yeah
Punch, whats happening brother?
Niggas be poppin that shit at me like its something new to me or something, know what Im talking about
I tell a nigga quick, that shit just a rerun to me, nigga
Ive been doing this shit since Vanguard, brother
And tell me whats happening with it
Niggas hate on me but hop right on my dick as soon as they see me
Soon as they see me, they be like
What up doc
Thats what they tell me every second around the clock
Everytime I clock in, rappers checkin they watch
Studio paid for, hours unlimited
Assholes, how many MCs I knock off they payroll?
How many God MCs I knock off they halo?
Hip-Hop ain’t dead, consumers changed up
Rappers love to see gold like the end of a rainbow
I stay low, like my socks under my ankles
Play the back like a turtle shell, know well
That my team got me if I ever slack on my shit, so if I fall?
Guess what, I dont even trip
Its like that, crushin little battle raps
Punchlines, I did that in 99, you think its a gold mine when you think of one
You think you hot, but I think you done
Like Queens, New York slang, look what the killer brung
Machine guns to a fight, fucking right
Pay the bill or Im turning out your lights, good night
I shatter niggas dreams, thinkin they the West Coast kings
Till I drop like visine, tell a nigga quick, it aint always what it seems
Like the stitching on swap meet jeans
Im itching to scratch a whack rapper, gun clapper, snuff him like a rude capper
Got a cool bladder, but Im pissed off, at ya
The real is back
Fuck the artificial, wont you let the realers rap
They scribble in they notebooks, me? I state facts
Safe estate, they know where the best be at
Whenever I ask, Are you not entertained?
Body any nigga that wanna holla my name
And what, no cut, this is Top Dawg gang
What the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up
Nigga said hed snatch my chain in the streets
What chain? I barely wear jewelry
So I ever had one, you barely seen it on me
And if I ever had a gun, you wouldnt know it was on me
So snatch it and then youre done
Im in a studio, just sipping on Parmesan
Thinkin about who could fuck with Kenny and Paulas son
I live this shit, try stop me, you wont live to shit properly
Catch four between your abdomen
Next time you see me, dont ask me who Im collabin with
Between me and you, some of the new West is actresses
New hate activists, lowkey cant stand our shit
But still we continue to drink laxatives
Cold blooded, make the label hand me your budget
This is mine dont touch , did I stutter?
Catch two, cats knew, I been a gorilla, welcome to the zoo
Yup, you little monkeys know what it do, come test me
The real is back
Fuck the artificial, wont you let the realers rap
They scribble in they notebooks, me? I state facts
Safe estate, they know where the best be at
Whenever I ask, Are you not entertained?
Body, any nigga that wanna holla my name
And what, no cuts, this is Top Dawg gang
What the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up
Dayum, you killin em K-Dizzle
And if you dont kill em, then you send em to hospitals
Sleepin on a recliner bed, with a thin pillow
Im with a white bitch, ass like a black widow
Bet I dribble to the end of my lifeline
So when I die, you can say I balled for a long time
The 0-8 Frankenstein, beast like Sasquatch
Feet size thirty-six, steppin on Hip-Hop cause thats my bitch
I write a rhyme, then she ride my dick
The girl is mine, I dont know the ho that you with
You niggas know this, Im way better than Ive ever been
So focused, like a sniper when he zoom in
Whats your motive?
I bet its to go against, like the GT
Get your bitch ass bit, all on these streets
Im the almighty K, Compton
Rep it til my very death day, let the reaper in his face
And recite every song from NWA
I pay homage for those great who paved the way
Wait, back to the subject of whos, and who doesnt do what I do
Bluffin until I touch em like a masseuse do
Nothing compares to me, but the throne, so tell em bring the chair to me
Im a rare bully, small nigga but I handle yall niggas like Im eight feet tall
Nigga
When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. We refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. So we have come to cash this check — a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice

No love for a friend, baby girl cold-hearted

On my knees, beggin, Please for the Lord to forgive me
I tried to bounce, but your spirit had bit me
Im drinkin the Remy, killin niggas, squeezin the semi
Ridin round in a Cutlass, shit, I need me a Bentley
I missed bail cause of you, nigga, went to jail cause of you
Trialed niggas in my cell cause of you
I squeeze shells cause of you, I wouldnt tell cause of you
Even probably brought my ticket down to hell cause of you
Damn, look, see, Im knowin that Im posed to shake
But anytime I leave you, Im feelin my heart ache
Hope you feelin my vibe, holmes
Nah, not a chick, I mean the shit that you drive, holmes
You did me wrong, you put me down
Made me feel low when youre around
And you broke my heart, you broke my heart
My chips went down, it was you I needed
But I was not down, baby, barely breathin
And you broke my heart
You broke my heart
Livin a double life, havin double shots of Patrón
With my mistress stead of my wife, I was on
Like the switch in my Marriott, can we get married, Dot?
I fucked her three times, then I was gone, apparently not
Story of the 80–20 rule is me
Movin cautiously, parked in the park with my back seat
Way back, her perfume on my white tee
Ignorin calls from my wifey
See, I was dead wrong, but was tryin to get a nut
And she had some great dome
Like the New Orleans Saints when theyre playin at home
Whats a nigga to think? Oh, just throw away some pussy
Then my conscious called me, Pussy
You dont understand, mama had ass
And Im quite a butt man, I love my wife, but, man...
I never thought of the day I would quit
Till I opened the door, seen a nigga fuckin my bitch
You did me wrong, you put me down
Made me feel low when youre around
And you broke my heart, you broke my heart
My chips went down, it was you I needed
But I was not down, baby, barely breathin
And you broke my heart
You broke my heart
Wow
I think I must have forgot or something
Like I aint hot or something
Like I dont make your girl take off her top or something
Im like
Hahahaha
LMAO
Hahahaha

Laugh at the haters in here
Ill be her favorite in years
She wanna play play
But, what more can I say say?
Jump in the coup and Im gone
I smell like money, I dont need no cologne
I just need me a freak
That can jump on the bone
Like an X-Ray technician
My rectangular prism
Says money sex then drugs
All cause Im 21
Like playing blackjack
Picture this kodak
Moment forever
K.Dot that dude
She sucked my dick and got frostbite
Im that cool
I got a pocket full of checks
Plus Im bouncing through the club
With a crazy two-step
And diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh
Ziploc fresh
Hoes wanna play play
What more can I say say?

Hahahaha
LMAO
Hahahaha
LMAO
Laugh at the haters in here
Ill be her favorite in years

Bottle of goose and Im gone
Watching her get loose
Like a third graders tooth
The shit that we on
Is the ultimate high
Double XL flow
Thats the ultimate vibe
Park that Lambi outside
Just to fuck with the haters
Put the Lami in drive
Watch em peel like potatoes
Holla LMAO
When they drunk and two-step
Like I never could pass
A sobriety test
I got a pocket full of checks
Plus Im bouncing through the club
With a crazy two-step
And diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh
Ziploc fresh
Hoes wanna play play
What more can I say say?
Im like
Hahahaha
LMAO
Hahahaha
LMAO
Laugh at the haters in here
Ill be her favorite in years
She wanna play play
But, what more can I say say?
Im in the club I can manage
Providing lenses
Make my view panoramic
Im out of this world
Im off of this planet
They dont say K.Dot is here
They say his spaceship has landed
And your access has been granted
Like a kitchen floor
But my floor is marble
I ride in the carpool because I got two whores
In the back of that chrome
See theyre all I need
Like Aaliyah alone
I got a pocket full of checks
Plus Im bouncing through the club
With a crazy two-step
And diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh
Ziploc fresh
Hoes wanna play play
What more can I say say?
Im like
Hahahaha
LMAO
Hahahaha
LMAO
Laugh at the haters in here
Ill be her favorite in years
She wanna play play
But, what more can I say say?
I don’t have time to die, clinging to these streets
All the lines that Ive cut, all the smiles Ive emptied
This is perfect, this is perfect
Her memories of me will fade with distance
All I care about is myself
I dreamed off DMT, fucked you lucidly
Can’t hear anybody else
Too many spilled drinks, precision’s gone extinct, oh no
You always fuck to forgive, but never ever give a fuck girl
I bet you love me for this night even if it’s ‘bout the pressure
Please, pain is all I need
I’m at your mercy, Im at your mercy
Please, I said its all I need
The paper birds
The paper birds
Im at your mercy
Watch me falter, make you weak
Doesn’t need much questions, no
I knew you longer than we lived
To give a fuck about the pressure, oh no
I made a contract to help my sins
Without an apology yes
I haven’t fell on my face in so damn long
Can’t change our problems with words alone
Please, pain is all I need
I’m at your mercy, Im at your mercy
Please, I said its all I need
The paper birds
The paper birds
The paper birds
The paper birds
Im at your mercy
The paper birds
The paper birds
Let’s talk about the street fightin
We liked it and never lost it
Thats gun riots, drive by it with no stalkin
That shit talkin, pissed off cause we piss poor
Mob pulls bleed see years of war
What you livin for? A couple stolen cars
White T’s, Jordan 4s, ratchet hoodrat broads
A human stash box before they start that martial law
Fuck planet Earth, we killed that turf, they want Mars
Pussy, was fat as mother love
Giving birth to Precious, hell yea I wanna fuck
She took my pacifier and tried to throw up them digits
Opened up my mouth to say she replaced them with sherm stick uh uh
She said you must be wet behind the ears, uh huh
I said Im blessed my mama wasn’t here
Then we started vibin and writin melodies to the sirens
Gun smoke in the air, we stared at the horizon
Hypnotizin, and murder was the case
And every time she wake up, she’s at another wake
Her name is Compton and she need a place to stay
And said if she can live in my heart, shed play my soul safe
Amen

Explode everytime you run, your ligaments stay ahead of me
Everybody say they killing the game, I shoot! and you dead Meat
 
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, faster than my bullet
K.Dot, you know that hes hot
I can do rhythm, hip hop, I can do pop
We talkin bout the black, we talking bout the brown
We talkin bout the white, it dont care who you around
Its all about the positivity when you with energy
If you knew me, then you know that God had witnessed me
If you see me then you know you cant intimidate me or be me
You can see we go for the energy
K104
Best hip hop and R&B, I be up in your store

She got on earrings, maybe baby girl got on hoops
She got that long, brown hair, its wrapped, yeah, she cute
He say Im killing this beat, K.Dot he never been weak
You know I got them flows and plus Ive always been cheap
And they talk bout strip clubs, I talk bout ladies and hugs
We talking bout more abuse, we talking bout these drugs
We talking bout my lady to the right, she real fly
Say your name again, girl, dont be shy
Lady Jade, she aways talkin bout gettin paid
And the haters they in our way and they getting sprayed
Cause the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Theyre always gonna play, play, play, play, play
No matter what they say, say, say, say, say
Were getting paid, boss, paid, boss
Whats up?
Staircases take me high 
Escalators take me high 
Ladders take me high 
Elevators take me high 
Staircases take me high 
Escalators take me high 
Ladders take me high 
Elevators take me high 
Started at the surface so my goal is up
Cause once you stay down then you gon get stuck
And Im just trying to climb and grind, the same time
Dangling off rooftops is what I call our hangtime
Walking through the hall, counting my flaws
My ego got caught in a elevator wall
Got it out, raised it to the rooftop, damn
Got to take the ladder cause the escalators jammed
Made it to the top but I aint even stopping
I said a prayer and a wish and turned my skateboard to a rocket
Im gone, to the skies, Im nothing more than another rebel
But Im still trying to take it to another level
Get up out the ghetto, maybe hop up on the shuttle
Jello with a piece of metal, my foot on the pedal
People say the world could fit into a little pebble
Then give me one good reason why you think we should settle
Staircases take me high 
Escalators take me high 
Ladders take me high 
Elevators take me high 
Staircases take me high 
Escalators take me high 
Ladders take me high 
Elevators take me high 
Look inside my eyes, you can see the universe fly
Deep inside my pupils the aliens camouflaged
Another way to shoot you, my mind is of mass destruction
Ill drop a gallon of Henny in the Big Dipper then dive
Bitches skinny dipping in my orbit
Ever seen a Martian? Gorgeous or some U.F.O. Porsches
I live inside the air plus I wear Air Jordans
So the mic is always near me whether swaggin or recordin
Journey on my voyage, you know the sky is the limit
But its ironic that method never applied to Kendrick
I catapult over your telescope and when Im finished
I grab the fire thats burning from Mars to light an incense
This rappings just a metaphor and I deserve a medal for
Writing another metaphor, about ambition
I envision me taking off astronautin myself
Fuck the world, Ill beat that bitch with the Orions belt
Staircases take me high 
Escalators take me high 
Ladders take me high 
Elevators take me high 
Staircases take me high 
Escalators take me high 
Ladders take me high 
Elevators take me high 
As Im floating all alone
I looked up and I start thinking
In a moment Ill be gone
Getting high so Im not sinking
As Im floating all alone
I looked up and I start thinking
In a moment Ill be gone
Getting high so Im not sinking
Getting high so Im not sinking
Staircases take me high 
Escalators take me high 
Ladders take me high 
Elevators take me high 
Staircases take me high 
Escalators take me high 
Ladders take me high 
Elevators take me high
Look inside the eyes of a broke nigga
See the stress on his face
Look at his heart, aint no love in the place
Whats on his mind? - murder, money and mayhem
If he dont see a dollar somebody visiting Satan
He grabbed his gat from under the mattress, he cocked it back
Then grabbed his gloves and a mask, then threw on his hat
Looked in the mirror and said, times is hard
So hard that he got gray hair on his balls - pause
In the ghetto, you destined to fall
Thats why its a must that we ball
Thats why he on the corner lurkin, waitin for a mothafucka to slip
Soon as he see the chance, he takin a risk
What should you do, when this nigga snatch you out of your whip
Empty out your pockets then snatch whats on your neck and your wrist---NOTHING!
Cuz when the gat in ya mouth, so speechless
Any false move and ya brains on the CE-ment
It gets gutter, when niggas starvin
Niggas will run inside ya house, kill you on target--heartless
This is way beyond a cold thriller
This the diary of a broke nigga
PUMP PUMP
Everybody lay down on the ground
Give me whatever you got right now
PUMP PUMP
Everybody lay down on the floor
Give me whatever you got plus more
When times is hard and Im prayin for change
My funds is low when I need some change
WOP WOP
Make sure you hide your goods when I come mista
You dealin with the diary of a broke nigga
Its been a whole month he still aint see no paper
Nigga losin weight every time that he wake up
Plus, he tired of askin niggas for favors
Cuz when they got mad they throw it back in his face
Thats foul, flagrant this nigga been slavin
In the spot all week still aint see no paper, thats fucked up
They say dont bite the hand that feeds you but if that hand dont feed you where would that leave you?
Now that the stress come
Cant turn back the hands of time
Got him thinkin back on what he shouldve done
First thing on his mind now get a gun
Shit you gotta eat, and you got a son
And a daughter, now thats two mouths to feed
And that money seems far like miles to reach
But its right there
But his brain clouded
Life on the wrong road cant reroute it
Caught the nigga, and showed him what that heater do
If you dont feed your wolves your wolves eat you
This is way beyond a cold thriller
This the diary of a broke nigga
PUMP PUMP
Everybody lay down on the ground
Give me whatever you got right now
PUMP PUMP
Everybody lay down on the floor
Give me whatever you got plus more
When times is hard and Im prayin for change
My funds is low when I need some change
WOP WOP
Make sure you hide your goods when I come mista
Ya dealin with the diary of a broke nigga
Lets go, Swime

That Styles P, that Jada, that Kendrick 
Oh, yall think its games being played around here, huh?
Well, they not 
Lighters in the air
The damage that we do is severe
The reinvention of the fresh, brand new every year
Them bullets hit him in his blood and flesh flew in the air
We put that work on commercial, we flew in the Lear
I lift the bar and the weights, then Im doin the stairs
They say the Lord only knows what I do to my peers
Tryna smoke, sell juice and pursue my career
So I keep a tight circle, I dont move with the squares
Rock a rugby like Puba, put two in the air
If you aint qualified to kill, you should move to the rear
Im from Yonkers, had to learn to conquer my fears
In the foreign, had to learn to conquer the gears
It’s the kick drum, yeah, it’s attached to the snare
I turn the Gat to the back, then Im crackin’ veneers
You niggas stagnated, on the block, trappin for wears

Nigga, nigga
Everybody, back up 
Man down

Don’t play with me, Ill do you somethin dirty
You talk to me crazy, Ill do you somethin dirty

Ill wake up the neighbors, comin through bright and early, woah
Cartel ties and dope bars
Life is a movie and death is the co-star
Mechanics to the game
Band of trail, foreigns the lane
If they heard that the driver is gettin coke off
We be in the part of the party that get roped off
Mingle with the plug and the judge and knock em both off
Questions that we askin ourselves, havin a smoke-off
Spendin money thats unaccounted for
If you scared to party with gangstas what you around us for?
We do what we want, my nigga, we get around the law
Yeah, its bubble whips and square links
LOX get respect, nigga, cause fear stinks
A chair at the table, its the commission, a rare thing
The beat come on, its us, nigga, you hear the kings
We still smell money in here, Frank
Raps like the dice game, nigga, we bout the clear bank 
Everybody, back up 
Man down 
Back the fuck up
Dont play with me, Ill do you somethin dirty
You talk to me crazy, Ill do you somethin dirty
How I feel lately, Ill do you somethin dirty 
Ill wake up the neighbors, comin through bright and early, woah

Where they keep the Glock in their pants, choppers right in the car
And if you step up on the dailys you might leave with a scar
If your gang tight might leave with a broad and like two of her friends might enjoy a ménage
And thats night life, in Watts California

Smoking on that medical, sipping on some medicine
Top Dawg letterman, she wanna ride, I let her in
She sexy than a motherfucker, plus, she brought her best friend
I guess thats a two for one, party at the Weston
Five star suites, bottles everywhere
Wanna fuck a star on the moon? I could take you there, biatch
I got a swagger of Mick Jagger
If you want her, you can have her, I done had her, we done had her
They be shooting at my ladder cause I’m standing on a pedestal
She gon give me good head just cause I’m ahead of you
Jay Rock, flyer than Hancock, no shit

Oh, I be P-I-M-P, 2-P-A-C, thats M.O.B
Him or me? You choose, I ain’t gotta do too much
I just lay back, smoke my weed, and turn my bottle up
Candy paint, leather guts, slide through like an avalanche
We don’t ride no Avalanche, so high I might never land
Trips to Never-Neverland, smoking on Afghanistan
A.K.A. that kush, nigga, I’m on Heaven’s roof, nigga
Big dawg, I go WOOF, nigga, don’t make me let my goons loose
Choppers make you shit your pants, thought you drunk some prune juice
Swear that I’m immune to, stuntin hard, gettin paper
Owning land, buyin acres, thats the reason why they hate us
I don’t give a fuck, middle finger out the window
Beamer, Benz or Bentley, Ferrari, sorry, we Enzo

And the bitches they be on it

Always online, stay connected like a modem
He tryna snap a picture, she bout to snap her neck
A real Blood pull up in a cherry cherry X

Kids is what make me feel so good
See you looking at the glory thats coming up into the future of life
See the younger youth is whats gonna make everything to keep going
After I done passed down the hill
Young and black!
 x2
Dont you know
That its true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Then theres a lot of funky things in this country
And theres a lot of good things too
But theres more funky than good
Weve changed some for the best
Awful lot of cases for the worst
And some, they have not changed at all
Walking down the street
Foggy eyes
Looking at the sky
Starry eyes
Searching for a place
Weary eyes
Crying in the night
Teary eyes
 x2
Dude, we got to get our minds together!
Anytime a brother was shot another brother in his own neighborhood
Then go to his funeral and turn over his own casket
They need to have the police down there
Cause see the niggas is N.A.A.C.P
Niggas aint actin like colored people
If I cant work and make it, I steal and take it
They come up to me with a nigga who can put air in a bottle and sell it
He can do it man
A nigga can sell anything
As I watch the sky change colors
The rain flooded the neighborhoods of the black brothers
The black mothers are stressing, the coroners have covered
Another statistic, episodes of a cold summer
The street runners got the same legs of Michael Johnson
The fast life surpassed life beyond the conscience
Profanity in the air, the children use the content
The vanitys in the air, that Louis bag: haunted
The black girl with the hair, thats kind of coarse
Her baby daddys in court, she smoking on a Newport
Seventeen with dreams of becoming a stripper
Or becoming an AIDS victim while touching them zippers
The life that we living in, things we would do just to live again
How can an angel forever live in sin?
 x4
You know, anybody that uses somebody else to gain is pimpin
Well, I tell you what soul brother, lookie here
Cant nobody pimp you but your pimp ass self
You understand?
Then theres a lot of funky things in this country
And theres a lot of good things too
But theres more funky than good
Shit aint gettin better
Weve changed some for the best
Awful lot of cases for the worst
And some, they have not changed at all
This song is dedicated to the murderers…
May God judge you accordingly. Good luck with that one…
You see the beast starts sprayin’
Thats what Im sayin’
Dem not playin’
Lord, Heaven Help Dem, Heaven Help Dem
See di man dem ‘pon di corner ‘pon cocked ready to draw
When dem face in-front of Jah
God, Heaven Help Dem, Heaven Help Dem
Feast your eyes realize this one
That the police are just people with guns
I mean people with funds and guns given the power of blood
To lick-a-shot in a di street and get your people to run — son
And when a cop dies, we all mortified
But when a cop kills he don’t need no alibi
I’m not sayin’ that they should be flawless
I’m telling you the world is lawless
Because we got young knuckleheads power tripping with they tools
And who they serving and protecting? Brother not you…
Not true? Why you think dem call dem babylon?
Cause them just agents of the system
Twist one up get your fist up in the air
Diallo, Bell, and Villanueva I say a prayer
I wonder do they include all the police murders when they go and calculate the murder rate each year?
They all say the average black man only live til 25
Pac died at 25
How many kids you know dead at 20? Five?
Now thats life, I know 10 thats crumbling in coffins
Dead as a doorknob
Fresh out of high-school and couldn’t find no job
Went straight to the grave
It’s crazy how the grim reaper in love with such tender age
I think about it as I gaze upon my ceiling
He woke up brushed his teeth then jumped in the shower
Stared at the mirror after he dried his face with a towel
And said, This can be the day I might pass away
From an altercation my homie got into yesterday
Or mistaken identity, him thinking I was his enemy
When I never seen him a day in my life
This is life for a young black man
With his future and his burner in his hand
While you’re on your grind, keep this in mind
We say…
Heaven help the man who takes another man’s life
Heaven help the man who makes the other man fight
Heaven help the man who fears the other man because he got a tan or he black or he white
Heaven help the mamma who just lost her by they guns and the justice that was there for safety
And heaven knows just why they had to take his life
And people are angry and people want answers
He wasn’t a nuisance he wasn’t a gangster
They want justice in these streets but there seems to be no justice for police and so
Heaven help the man who crush another man will
Heaven help the man who makes another man kill
Help the rioters who’s going crazy
In the streets all they’re really screaming out is save me
Kendrick Lamar, I want to thank you very much for doing this song
It’s Jonathan Emile, 514 stand up
Franco Proietti on the alto saxophone
Jonathan Emile on the beat
This goes out to anybody who has been a victim of abuse of power
Hate, violence. It’s time we stand up
Ferguson aye, to the world. Ahh..
Montréal, New York, ayy
Dem killin’ da people dem
Lyin’ to the people all the time. Ahh..
Inna da streets you see a rainbow
We’re marching for our rights
These streets is Jurassic, cowards get asthematic
Astronauts hover throughout the atmosphere
Thats the ghetto bird. Pull up on the curve
Wassup homie!, smoke a nigga then dip
Its the immaculate, verbal assassin
Strangle your perfect etiquette to an accent
This the Jesus of Nazareth
Spittin gold policies to a world unknown
In a cherry low low, with four zones of weed
No sticks, no seeds
Prestigious when I pulsate the 50 states
My need for speak can corral the largest crowds
Mosh pit, with a big dick screamin Bitches aint shit!
She gobble gobble for hours, I jumped in the shower
I dismantle, devour hardest Emcees, softer than clam chowder
No challengers can compete, their childish and weak, detrimental
Hazardous hazard to instrumentals, intertwined with God and Frankenstein
Im Corrupted
Im Corrupted
Gimme a hundred gs, for every emcee I dropped to their knees
Verbally useless
Oh you got the juice!? I squeeze you juiceless
Catch you, hang you, from any nooses
Been the truth since Snoop and Tha Pound was fuckin over Ruthless
Young and Im ruthless
21 with 21 guns, shot and saluted for Pac
Lyrical cyclops, lasering in on paper and fraudulent friends
Bitch yous a bitch in disguise, and bitches get ten
Bullets to their midsection, Mr. Lethal Injection
In the regal higher than church steeples
I swear to God, can ya lyrics in a jar
Im a pterodactyl tearin ya squad like pardon
Me and Terrace Martin enacting Martin
Cannibal coexisting with the coldest, that mean Im the sickest
And Thera-flu wont do, whenever Im kicking the wickedness
Explosive, cinematic, smoking
Like the barrel of this TEC aimin at ya neck
Im Corrupted
Im Corrupted
Im from C-O-M-P-T-O any nigga can get it
The lil homie strapped and he with it
At the Avalons swap meet, wassup fool!?
Blunt longer than Rosecrans
I grab the devil then slow dance
Practice trigonometry
Practice my aim on rooftops eating pastrami sandwiches
You are counterfeit, worthless piece of verses surf this
West Coast with a big scope kill all yal
Its Top Dawg, TDE, CPT
Quick to tell a bitch jump on my dick A-S-A-P
Complete havoc composer, disorder: rhyme addict
Slaughter houses full of Joeys, Joells, and Royces for ya
Live from the area code of 310
Laughing all the way to the bank with 3 elmos
Three 64s, 1 bottle of goose
Im the truth
You can put ya hand on the bible and shoot
Im Corrupted
Swallow your pride and then eat a dick
Make the rulers apologize, you aint ruling shit
Im Rick Rubin in 85 with the beard thick
Thick bitch type peruvian slanted eyes that squinch
I tell you that Im one up
Sun down, or sun up
Son, I son niggas
I probably fucked your mama
With no condom
Thats good pussy, pussy
Tell it to your honor
This trauma is Jeffery Dahmer
It took me too many moons to fuck up this new platoon
Get ambushed or kick pushed with push brooms
Man look, your man look like sweet water
Cornbread that break under pressure when hes caught up
They call me said I gotta crawl before I walk
And if I ran my mouth then my legs would get cut off
Im just a young boss in the batcave
Back against the wall
I came back with them back pains
Tell em put my name on a gym ball
Like Im Derrick Rose
Ho, know my gym
And players not allowed
Im spiking your game towel
And spiking your Gatorade with gasoline Im foul
Im in the crowd like Artest and them
I move the crowd like Artest and them
Punchlines mean I really go and punch civilians
Crunch time mean I take it to the hole
Not a basket, but rather this good pussy that Im in
I assassin you niggas
I make your weight shape thin
Blank tapes in your deck
You can still break they necks
They hear it, you need clearance from the label just to spin
I need to clear it with the bank just to spend
Club appearance go for twenty-five racks
When you getting it like that, shit, it gotta be a sin
So Lord forgive me yes Im a sinner
But these hoes is with me cause Im a winner
Back when we ate canned food for dinner
I coached fools to protools to make my agenda
Im tofu, Im nasty like tofu
I wish a motherfucker would
Get your whole career injured
Nigga, thats assault with a deadly weapon
I killed your favorite rapper
Favorite rapper last record
I fucked your favorite actress on the matress
What a blessing
Make that pussy ante up
She call my dick antidepressant
Im really not impressed with
None of you niggas stressing
That some of you niggas blessed with
The gift to carry the presence
Picking popping
Im popping big shit with label investments
Fifteen minutes go for fifty seconds
Last night, I spent twelve hours inside a session
Came up with shit, writers block
Niggas up in this dressing like
Who the fuck cares? Who the fuck cares?
Even when you Slumdog, youll still be a millionaire
Nigga playing Santa Claus will make sure you hold deer
Have him first put that bitch in a hearse while Rock steer
Church to you pussies
You push me, get pap smeered
Burst out your cookie
I read it, my fortune is here
Look, this be that shit that make real niggas grab they dicks
And bitches rubbing on they tits
Until they fingers monkey wrenched
Monkey see what monkey do
You monkeys never make no sense
Jump up a tree, shit on you
Shitting bricks that can build a castle
No hastle when breaking your picket fence
Know pterodactyls that still exist
And clap you if you resist
Cooperate, go home and seen they daughters copulate
And you at risk
You wear a bracelet, we want your wrist
You can taste it from planet Pluto
Doggone it, you panic just like a poodle
Rip out your culo, then kudos
Two Door regal, El Caminos, and two more
Cause I 
Wipe it off on my shoe, ho
Before you your Menthol
Meant to get smoked then sent off
To Jamaica
No trace of a Laker with Toni Kukoc
Means aint no hood
Hopping California JACO
Watching Snoops latest prince get down
Bitch, start popping fireworks
K. Dot
I want all the kush
I want all the bottles
I want all the cash
I want all the models
I want it all

Ok, kush, bottles, shut up, swallow

Got a couple girls in the Benz
And they all got friends, headed back to the condo
And I make all they asses clap, clap, clap, bravo
I want that lottery money
That “please dont say hi to me” money
That I could go back to my hometown
And get my city outta poverty money
Dont lie to me honey, I know that thang fake
Put a candle on that ass, tell her “Give me that cake”, wait
I rep NY, big boy in the big city

Move like a sh-sh-sh-shooting star
And they know who we are, big pimping in the building
Got about a million, throw it at the ceiling
Layin smack dead in the face of civilians
Tell em Im chilling with Patron on ice
And my home on ice, and my neck on ice
Lo-lo-lo-look at my ring, Im a hustler string
You should learn me twice
Imma grind till I die, thats no lie
Do with my middle finger held up high
Fuck the world, if it fry
I know one thing, I did my job
And thats get what? Move, tell a lie
Sippin on Henny, smokin on ly
Never let a penny pass me by
Move with the Benjis by my side
Thats my sidekick, you better watch it
What I mean is, dont touch my pockets
Man big debts, cut them checks
Hundred mill plus, nothing less
I want all the kush
I want all the bottles
I want all the cash
I want all the models
I want it all
I want it all

Time will tell but Ill rhyme until I skip time, Im Michael J. Fox
Got 86 on that dash, got 87 in cash, and Im born in 88
Born and raised in New York, so you do the math
Pass that dutch, oh

Writer At WarKendrick Lamar in his own words.A lot of times in interviews, people ask me things like, “How does it feel now? What have you bought your mom and your pops and family?” Nobody ever really asks about what it’s like trying to adapt to fame and money and how much of a depression it can make for you. How much of a depression it could put you in knowing that so many kids hang on to your words. I can’t make a song like “i” without being in that dark place. “i” comes from going overseas, going to New York, being in L.A. and hearing kids saying, “Kendrick, I was gonna kill myself last week. Section.80, good kid, m.A.A.d city saved my life.” Or “I was gonna kill myself tonight until I came to your show.”
I believe that they are telling the truth. At first I wasn’t so sure, maybe it was just they were excited to meet me. But then they showed me their wrists and had all these different scars from when they tried to take their lives but failed. Or I look into their eyes and their pupils are dilated and they on all these types of meds and drugs, it’s a whole different story to me. That’s when I learned that while I’m making music for myself, drawing from my own experiences and conflictions and battles within myself, this teenager listens to every word I say. And that’s spooky
I think one of my biggest battles within myself is embracing leadership. You always grow up and you hate the term “role model.” You would say, “I don’t wanna be a role model. I don’t want none of that.” But in actuality, you are the biggest role model. It’s impossible to fight the title of role model. Especially when the type of music I make is so personal. People feel like they can relate to me or that they are me. They feel like they know my whole life story even though we from different worlds. So when I go out and meet them in public, I don’t get a response like, “Kendrick, will you sign this real quick?” Or, “I wanna just take this picture with you.” No, they want to have full conversations. I find out that they live their lives by my music and that right there is somethingWhen I try to soak it all in, that’s the only thing that kind’ve scare me, feel me? Life is sad in general and I’m meeting these different people every day. It kind’ve snaps me back into reality outside of what I do. Outside of the girls, outside of the cars, the money, it really ain’t that important when you meeting somebody that’s still in the struggle. These the people that live their lives in dark spaces, every day , you know, and they use my music as some sort of tool to keep going, almost like a Bible, you know? These kids feel like they got nothing to believe in but they see me and say, “Kendrick, I believe in you. I believe in your music.” And what happens it puts me in some type of space where it’s almost like some type of worship or responsibility, but I know it. I can see itAnything I say or do, I don’t take back, I don’t regret.I think one of my biggest assets is not knowing how famous I am. Or even excluding the word, I hate the word “famous.” I’m aware of it. I know people treat me different because of it. And the more I am aware of that and play into it, the more I become detached from the real world. So it’s really about balance. The more somebody opens the door for me and I walk through without acknowledging that they opened the door for me, the more I become separate from others
I had a talk with Lauryn Hill and she said, “Try to completely throw away your ego.” How many times can you throw away an ego, you know? It’s tough. It’s something we all battle with. I battle with it all the time and the idea of being in all these places—the big spots, all the events, the lights—it’s all for your ego. It’s all for your own confirmation to be like, okay, I’m somebody. But truthfully, you’ve always been somebody. You don’t need the lights
I try to think about that. Also, I like to look at old pictures and think of things from back in the day that kind of draws me back to where I came from. I think a lot of times when artists are in so much of the now, they only think of what’s ahead of them, which is cool. But I look at pictures of the small little apartment that I come from in Compton and things like that. And it always trips me out when I get too far out there where I’m missing phone calls or not responding to text messages on time or my peoples is hitting me, my moms is and I can’t get back to her. Sometimes you on the go and you forget about those little things
It’s definitely a gift and a curse when you make music as personal as I make it. Of course you get the kids out there that say that they relate to you and this song saved their lives, and you helped them with their assignment for this and that. And then at the same time, your privacy is not respected. And all entertainers go through it, but moreso the ones that make very personal music, because it’s not just me you’re focusing on now when I’m out in public, but also on individual characters that I’m talking about in my music. So that’s a whole other ballgame and it’s just something that I’ve gotta acceptWhen I’m completely drained of inspiration, that’s when I’m finished with the project.I think the way it is, the positive aspect of me gaining more listeners and giving them some type of motivation and relatable effect, it’s more than running from somebody snapping a picture of my mom’s van that was on my album cover, that she actually still has. I’d never think that would happen, but it’s happened plenty of times to where she has to hide the van now. She can’t drive that thing no more. And she’s old school, she wanna drive it. But I never want them to be in this type of world, because not everybody can handle it. I think the average person wouldn’t be able to handle the day-to-day. It’s a lot of things you gotta deal with. So me doing that, it’s just a piece of me. I gotta find balance and try not to really get too frustrated over it
I’d be lying to you to say I knew good kid, m.A.A.d city would be as successful as it has been. In the beginning I was very doubtful. Once I was done, the jitters hit me so fast. I was so confident in making it, because I was like, “This is it, man. Nobody heard this story and if you heard it, you heard it in bits and pieces but I’m finna put it to you in a whole album—from Compton, from the hood, from the streets—it’s a whole other perspective and light, I’ma go back and do the skits just like how Biggie and Dre and Snoop and ’Pac did it. And I’ma tell my story.” Then I wrapped up with it and said, “Man, what’s on the radio right now? I don’t think they doin’ skits and things like that.” I don’t know if the people are gonna understand what I’m talkin’ about on this album because it’s almost like a puzzle pieced together, and albums ain’t been created like this in a long time. Albums that actually still reach the masses, at least
My whole outlook on being signed was to have an actual massive commercial successful album. This is what you think as a kid. You don’t know nothing about creative process and things like that. So I didn’t know how blessed I was to actually go and make an album that I can create and control 100 percent. When I was done with it, I was like, “Man, these people believe in me like this? They let me just do this whole thing by myself like this? I don’t know. Y’all sure I’m right?”
I was nervous because I didn’t think the people would understand it. And I get a call from Pharrell. He said he had a copy of the album and it’s amazing. And I was like, that call was right on time because that was when I was feeling super insecure about it. Pharrell said, “Never feel that way again. When that little negative man come behind your head, always follow your first heart, and that was your first heart, to put the album out like this.” This is his words verbatim, he said, “Watch what’s gonna happen.”I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten.When I come up to certain artists, artists that I’ve always looked up to, and they can recite my records that wasn’t the single, that puts me in a space where, okay, this is a person I always respect and to get their respect back was almost like confirmation for me. I always thought confirmation would be having a lot of money, and things I could do for my family
Because that was what we was taught when you come from these urban neighborhoods, you was taught that having money was success and that’s all you see, all you know. So once I got the money and everything else that comes with it, I felt like I wasn’t satisfied. I’m looking around like, this is great security, but I don’t even spend it on myself, I spend it on my loved ones. That makes me feel good knowing I can support somebody that’s in need. But at the same time, I’m feeling like, okay, what’s after this? So what I realized was, my greatest fulfillment of accomplishment was having somebody that I looked up to for so many years and knowing that I put in that same dedication and work and them saying, “Thank you.” And them being able to recite them lyricsKendrick Lamar - Bitch, Dont Kill My Vibe (I think the first time I played “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe” for Andre 3000 was before it came out. I never share my album while I’m creating. I think that the situation with Andre was one of those things where he was in the studio with Dre and Dre was like, “Play some stuff .” I can’t say no to Dr. Dre. But me creating music, I never really play music for anybody, even people inside the camp because it can almost sway your creative process 100 percent. So along with that, I cut off everything on the radio; I really just duck off from music. Because I’m gonna be influenced and I don’t want to be. That has always been my process. I just feel like, it’s really the only prized possession that I actually can control, you know? It’s selfishness for sure, but it’s my selfishness and I own it
I know a lot of people that go around and play music to get approval because some are not so confident in the things they do. But with me, personally, I can only speak for myself, this is me. Anything I say or do, I don’t take back, I don’t regret. That’s how I was feeling at the time and that’s how y’all gonna get it, and I own it. Love me or hate me, I own it. It is what it is. And that’s how I look at itFrom 13 years old to the time I was 21, I was in a mode of mastering how to be a rapper. Like a rapper’s rapper, using my tongue as a sword, a fuckin’ barbarian. That’s all it was about, slaying words. So when I turned 21, 22, somewhere around there, I got into a mode where it became more of a writer aspect for me rather than just being a rapper ’cause this is around the same time where cats weren’t putting out mixtapes anymore. They was putting out full bodies of work and wasn’t even signed to a major label. So by that time, that’s when I started developing and actually constructing my music from a writer’s point of view. good kid, m.A.A.d city was probably one of them albums that you could unfold out into a book and read it. And that’s how I treat everything. Everything is critical like that from here on out. It’s the art of writingSo you ask yourself in the midnight hour, ‘Who am I? Is this really what I’m supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What’s my responsibility?This is more than just music for me. This is actually a piece of me. I’m obsessed with it. And that’s how I take it. When I make my music, it comes from a genuine space where I’m already spreading myself wide to the world. So during my process in creating it, that time is for me, personally. That’s for my heart, those are my memories that helped me up with these lyrics and get inspiration. That was my memories. Taking those inspirations and going into that booth, that’s something that I hold dear
When I’m completely drained of inspiration, that’s when I’m finished with the project. When I start maybe trying to tamper with things that I shouldn’t tamper with, I’ve already had done, that’s when I’m done and I know I’ve exhausted inspiration. That comes with not wanting to actually rush the process. I always want to put it down to the last idea, and once I’m drawn away from it, that’s when I say, okay, let’s take all these pieces—they might not even be songs—let’s take these pieces and construct it. So what I want to say, and how I want to execute it becomes clear
It’s the best part because the things that I say on my records—this is another reason why I don’t just play records for people—you won’t necessarily get it until it’s constructed. I know what type of artist I am. I’m not an artist that’s gonna give you a single and say, “This is what my album’s gonna sound like, go sell it.” That’s not me. I’m just not that artist to give you one or two songs here and there and run with it. Everybody has their own niche. With mine, I just own it, and I know that’s exactly what that is. And I wanna keep that lane. I don’t want to jump in somebody else’s lane and try to do their moves because it may not work for me like it worked for them. So I stay where I feel like I’m inspired
What’s crazy to me is that I feel the same energy now that I felt before my first album. I know there’s lot of pressure for me on this new album but it don’t necessarily scare me. It’s almost confirmation, like, go in there and challenge yourself just the same way you challenged yourself the first time. Because I remember going to radio stations and them telling me this: “Dr. Dre had Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Eminem, you seen what Eminem did, right? Yeah, uh huh. Kendrick Lamar, he from the West Coast, and Compton, too. Dre from Compton, you see the legacy he left. Yeah, so I hope that album is good. Matter fact, you got the weight on your shoulders right now.”
Thank you for that. Let me get in the studio now since you just put the battery in my backI thought I was going to win Best Rap Album at the Grammys. I put a lot of work in on my album and the biggest thing for me is knowing that it was basically an underground album. It didn’t have big No. 1 records on it and there wasn’t really any commercial hits. It was great songs and I think the message behind it reached as many listeners and believers as a super mainstream album. So for me, when you’re saying, “rap,” that would be my definition of something that deserved an accolade. Yep
I found out a lot about myself in these past two years. It’s scary. I know more about myself now than any other point of my life. I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten. I was a pretty shy and to myself type of person as a kid. And now 15 years later I’m in front of people every day, tens of thousands of people. So that makes me more of a recluse. That makes me not come outside of my world on the outskirts of L.A. and bounce around different places and things like thatWhat I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place.So you ask yourself in the midnight hour, “Who am I? Is this really what I’m supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What’s my responsibility?” It’s a real trippy thing, you feel me? And I think it’s something that nobody can understand; only an artist can. Things change for you with success when you get money. I noticed when people started treating me a little bit different, the people that I cared about the most, my close friends and family. The artist don’t necessarily change, it’s usually the people around them. Their expectations of you can sometimes be out of control. You can do one thing that can trigger something mentally in them that makes them think that you don’t care about them or you don’t fuck with them no more when that’s not the case. You’re just more focused on what you have to do because it’s biggerThe moment I start seeing change in people around me, that’s when I know something is a little bit different. Then there’s tension in the air that I probably can’t necessarily deal with at the moment. ’Cause when the industry don’t understand me, and the business don’t understand me, these are the people I can run to. What happens when I can’t run to them?
Artists just get paranoid in any situation and circumstance. I’m always paranoid. I’m already a person who thinks a lot; sometimes I may overthink things or think too much. So when you’re put into a space where you feel like you can’t necessarily trust your close ones, that can do some whole other crazy thing to you psychologically. Seriously. All you got is you and God at the end of the day
The hard time for me was probably when I was on the road. It’s almost like you go on the road and you’re gone for two years. And this place you’ve known your whole life, these people you’ve known your whole life, everything is different when you come back. And you feel like, damn, your sanctuary is now on that tour bus. That dirty, stinky, smelly tour bus. And that’s one thing, among numerous other things, that have been hard sometimes. To the point where people are pulling for you left and right, where you feel like you don’t have control over your own life. Over your own well-being
What I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place. And I’ve seen and heard some of the greats go out because of it. And I’m saying this right now to let everyone know, it’s real and you have to be mentally steady 100 percent in order to keep doing it at a high level and still maintain your sanity
When the lights shut off, an artists dream is that their work will stand the test of time. The ones that influence our culture are the ones we most remember. Here, two powerful creative forces come together to elevate the status quo and lay ground to their legacy. This is their poetry. Sing about them. This is part one

Wanna compete with this tech-a-nique?
Big gun, take a seat

Touch socks in the suite, big name in the streets
Top Dawg ENT, GED, TNT
40 Glock pop shit, bust into the Glock click
Semi-automatic lips spit when the pin itch
Tighter than a closed fist
Product make your nose twitch
All that bold shit have you buried where my dog piss
Tortoise speedin through the game like Porsches
Fortress, thousand dollar frames on our porches
Cautious, cock it and explode the track
Your brain over wax, its solved over rap
Shots breathe, got power tell the cops freeze
Countin all this bread, Aftermath not Eve

Whats the reason for this nonsense?
You listen to your boys
You should have reasoned with your conscience 
You wasnt built for this content
I send a chick at you that dabble in bondage
Tie you to the bed post as you respond with kindness
Even let her blindfold you, you love how she dominant
My Spanish chick from Brooklyn, Bed-Stuy
Who specialize in givin Brazilian Neckties
While I sip a Mai Tai
Cause my time is far more important
Than to be shootin it out with tough guys
 still flow like faucet water
My niggas half step like foster daughters
My mic can slaughter a nation like the angel of god
You think this lyrical homicide nigga?
Action speaks louder than words
Actions— Action speaks louder than words
Action speaks louder than words
Actions— Action speaks louder than words
Not wearing two chains, but I keep it TRU
Real niggas with me; my real bitches, too
Out for Trump change, yeah, I gotta eat
Patience is a virtue, something flawless gonna come to me
Im rollin OG, blow it out the roof
She eyeballing me, macking hoes like CPUs
She know me, mightve saw me on TV too
Thugging with the homies, tryna make it, kicking ghetto tunes
Out the gutter, bitch, what your focus is?
Small-time hustling, now its time to do it big
I want it all, fancy cars, yeah the newest shit
Came a long way, riding round on my Buick shit
Win by any means—who said it best?
Kobe Bryant mind-state, Im shooting til Im accurate
Cant stop it til Im a couple million strong
Grinding to put my loved ones on, in my zone
Not your average rapper, step inside my universe
Far from you average rappers, nothing is by the book
Welcome to Hells Kitchen, show you just how to cook
The city is full of bishops, putting pressure on rooks
My vision so panoramic, my brain on another planet
To reach it, you gon need more than a neuro-ologist, honestly
To be honest, far from lyrical
Gifted with miracles; when I rhyme, its a ritual
Spit it, it hit your spiritual, nigga
Im planning my day of triumph
All I got is my word and my sword, choppers and bibles
I pray—pray a nigga never get in my way
Cause thatll be the moment he make his bed and just lay
And now, you see me shining, perfect timing, Im a Top Dawg
I love this feeling, make a killing when Im on tour
All my life surrounded by negativity, jealousy
Through the midst of it all, this what they telling me
Motherfuckers cant rhyme no more, bout crime no more 
When I was in the streets, I put them numbers on the board 
I robbed two niggas, put they chains in the pawn shop 
Got five hundred, spunt it all on a quarter piece 
Made about fifteen hundred 
Them new Js was about two hundred 
The word got back, they know I done it 
Spent a thou on a few new drummers
Took it to them, cause I knew they was coming
Three yards left 
Ran through those like first-and-goal
Naw Im back, burnt pistol close, like, Who got the dough?
Yea, DMX of the projects 
Skinny Black nigga with a complex, fuck your Pyrex 
Robbing everything, no patience for the nonsense

Right
Gather round hustlas thats if ya still livin
And get on down with this THC vision
The last of a dying breed too many whack artists
So tell em Parappa the Rapper nigga rap harder
Like being garbage some type of disease
I take em out their misery, make it harder to breathe
Aint no problem to me, call me Father MC
Pay homage to a God, bitch fall on your knees
Hood booga wannabe house wife gassed off nini
High sadity meanie tryna emulate the TV
But this real, fuck how you feel
Call of Duty mode with these verses, lot of kills
First niggas doubted the flow, now how you feel?
If this was back in the days youd get a lot of gills
Gimme mines, I really rhyme
Yup really Im, one of the illest niggas doin it
Or these niggas is losin it, silly minds
They try to style on a New York nigga
Like my flow aint cold like a New York winter
I dont stunt, I regulate
Seen empires separate
Best friends kill best friends everyday
For petty sake not even heavyweight, its never good
Theres a Rich Porter story in every hood, DZA
No matter how far we go
We forever be real, well never fold
Know my niggas stay down, we all we know
We gotta get it so we live it just remember what we do and wont stop
My turbulence put a burden on young herbs
Once its crackin its a chain reaction minus Yung Berg
Im on the verge of excellence kill em off with no evidence
Take a shot at the Excorcist then X em out with these words
Panoramic views be tumblin out my mind
This aint 1992 bullets tumblin out no nines
Big AKs like Alicia Keys abbreviated
And nowadays niggas stand behind em like Clive Davis
Clyde Drexler, before the hood got dribbled niggas right up on the stretcher
An understatement said that K. Lamar was under pressure
Dont press ya luck when Im pressed for time
Cuz when the press get this verse, their sure to press rewind
The presidents prayer cant save us in my cul-de-sac
Theres codeine, crack and cognac enough violence to keep the devil smilin while we whilin on them corners with them ropes and rats
Nigga build a trap house, hope his homies dont run his trap
See the Feds and tap out thats wrestler shit
Dont rest your case as a gangsta because you wrestled your bitch
We move in silence, like the potato tip when we ridin
And we ride rotten, 2 choppers found dirty sirens
You aint been where I been, I know where Im goin
And lifes a bitch, I know that she hoing
I know what Im sewing, what I reap
I know that Im flowing like water from sea or water from creek
And if I dont speak, I know you aint growin
Cuz Im a leader, respect it when you see em
Accepted by yo new bitch, yo old bitch and yo BM
Yall always on that BS and PS Im takin all fades
Im takin off first, this G6 is on its way
Feeling like a mother fucking animal
Hannibal Lecter of 2012
Elected to execute every rapper that has excelled
If music is your calling
Youre falling, pick up yourself
If a nigga said he could see me
Bet he told you in Braille, fucker
Put you in front of the street then buy you some bread
Nigga you lunch meat, shouldve worked at Subway instead
Goliath couldnt bare my triumph
Im a leader, walk behind me as I walk through Zion
Swinging swords like Im sparring with a Spartan
Watch they face drop when the beat drop
I drop a real jewel like a Martin, fool
Me and curtains ballin like peewee kirkland callin em kirk franklin
Stomp em, leave em hurting
No judgement for a plaintiff
They tried to find me guilty for spitting filthy as O.D.B
But Ive been O.D. since 03
Thats March 14th, my first recordings
I kicked it like sweet chin
Music on Chuck Norris
Look, look, look
Im J-A-Y, Rock to be exact
Niggas said gardens, Watts on the map
Hm, story of this eastside nigga
All my life in the ghetto on the peace side nigga
Where across the tracks, opposites attract
Niggas go hard for the color of they flag
Dope man money, welfare recipients
Unfit mothers never heard of obedience
Hos so devious, niggas all talk
Right around the corner, deja vu
Same old shit, something like re-runs
Gotta stay sharp, if you slip then you bleed ?
Guns in the Levis, 501s
Niggas dont box, they buy more guns
Uh, thats how it is on these L.A. streets
Dont sleep, dont sleep
Look, catch me sitting in my truck
Remy in this cup
No tags on this bitch, but I dont give a fuck
I ride until the wheels fall off
Thats some real shit
Never let them get in your mind, never reveal shit
Let a nigga know your feelings, business and all
Hes the type of nigga riffing and wishing on you to fall
Fake niggas try and impersonate your character
Thats why I got my mothers fucking eyes on them scavengers
Watch em!
My daddy told me that every day
Pray for late Charles, why he have to pass away?
Thinking about my pops, then the stress starts to kick in
Roll me up a fat ass blunt and start drinking
Damn!
Then reality starts to set in
Im married to the streets and I aint never had a wedding
I stop selling dope because niggas started telling
Sex, money, and weed: the life we start living
Guns in the closet for niggas who start tripping
Stay in the house when them choppers come out spitting
Stay on your job
Keep your eyes open on every corner
The blink of an eye, and youre a goner
No wronger, tell em about the pains of this hunger
Shock em like thunder
And the ? going bonkers
Just living my life up on some cool shit
So, nigga just miss me with all that bull shit
I aint worried about these niggas trynna hate on me
To me its all just jealousy
Dont wanna see another brother get his money
So I roll on, roll on, roll on ,roll on
Everyday stay fresh and stiffy
And oh boy your girl is out to get me
Man the streets is filled with envy
So I roll on
Roll on
Roll on
Rolling up the cronic, isnt it ironic
My money rolling like Sonic
Divas in my lap up and down like hydraulics
Got a pimp player degree but never did college
Niggas steady hating when you steady getting dollars
Got 99 issues your bitch aint part of my problem
Used to be broke now Im getting cabbage
Got marble on the floors in my project palace
No more crack money getting paid off my ballads
Went from dirty money to visas you see my balance
Welcome to my habitat East side gutter
I could whip you a cookie, best believe its gonna be butter
Then I hit the club pissy drunk of that bubba
Gotta stay high til I die motherfucker
Imma get this money while you niggas envy
Haters want me to schh
Then come and get me
Please
I aint worried about these niggas trynna hate on me
To me its all just jealousy
Dont wanna see another brother get his money
So I roll on, roll on, roll on ,roll on
Everyday stay fresh and stiffy
And oh boy your girl is out to get me
Man the streets is filled with envy
So I roll on
Roll on
Roll on
Kendrick Lamar, young nigga
Before I ever wear a chain, I make sure you know my name
Im the same good kid from the block where you was raised
Didnt have a pot to piss in peeing in your pjs
You see my story is a story untold by the kid from Compton making straight as for new clothes
Surrounded by bullets from one of my relatives foes
Because he been a killer since he was 12 years old
The price of being guilty by association got me places I aint ever been
Like in back of the swap meet niggas trynna test my chin
Squaring up like a nerd before summer school begin
Then break when bullets breaks wind
All I wanna do is rap
But its a wrap
When you living inside of Iraq and
George Bush in the culdesac
You get pushed and you righteous act
Its a murder charge on your back
Can I captivate this captive before you try peel my cap
Can I live
Huh
Kendrick Lamar
Baby, I wanna, I wanna get you to understand
I love you, and I love her too
But that may be too much for you to deal with
So I wrote a song about it, you wanna hear?
Well, here we go
My life is Mardi Gras
And shes the life of the party, yall
Its like ring around her rosy
When I came around they chose me
And I make em feel famous, famous, famous, famous
Winner circle, square dont fit
And Im caught up in a triangleship
Living life in a triangleship
And Im caught up in a triangleship
Living life in a triangleship
And Im caught up in a triangleship
Yup, Im caught up in the middle of this love thing
I keep trying to escape the ball and chain
My main dame holds me down for the winter season
My side piece just a winner, thats for many reasons
Insecurities inside of myself
Have me not be able to picture you with nobody else
Im caught up between two beautiful women
Who both could clean and play their position - its like
I know Im wrong, but I cant seem to get it right
Process of elimination, hell of a decision to make
Take two and add me
Never knew a real commitment would ever involve three
The one she got a temper, always make sure Im fair
The other one she leaves me lonely cause shes focused on the bread
Yeah, can a man ever be so lucky?
I guess thats why these women dont trust me
A 3ChordFold
Its hard being the star of a plot when
Love and lust at the same time got them
So I doubled up, put five on, they got ten
Gambled with their hearts, had the ball and I dropped it
To leave would be the death of me, dearly departed
Dont know how I got by being partially honest
A thin line between love and hate
Yeah, I crossed it, wait
Love is no guarantee, I got options
Fate, its me and her, its me and she
Multiple choices, not A and B
A test I was destined to fail for sure, boy
Rather be stingy than to see you hugging on old boys
Oh boy, Im just a man with a lot of love to give
And hope you understand it was never my intent
To mislead neither of you, but it is what it is
Cupid tried to aim straight, but I guess cupid missed
3ChordFold
Deep in his love
Not sure if thats what this still is
We used to get away, and love, play
Innocent as kids then
Something else happened
We wanted different things
Days turned to nightmares
And over time things changed
Life is funny that way
Time is money, and my bank statement states that Im in need of more than
Fuss and fights and making up
And waking up after watching me sleep
Just singing songs about moving on
Cause trust aint slept here in weeks
So lets leave
We talk about til color fades from the leaves and falls again
And winter wind springing up in the same thing
Still here
Summer crystal blue sky clear
We just living on love
From hearts trenched and trembling in fear
Chord one, the free loader
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a good feeling, yall
Gotta see how I’m chillin once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
20 on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, cant forget
Now I can lend all my ear into how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what menll do
20 on 6, he didnt hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu, my American tongue was leery
Hopped out the gas station, a homeless man with 100 grand
Who passed me just asked for 10 grand, stressing about dry land
Blue skies, powder blue skies then crack open
Piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didnt believe it, told him beat it
Contributed money just for his pipe, I couldnt see it
He said my son, temptation is one thing that I defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothing less, nothing more
I told him I didnt have it then close my door
Tell me how much how much a dollar costs?
And this a freestyle beginning
And if you know me you know K.Dot TDE winning
We are the champions, we disagree
You cant see it then you best believe
This the cypher, I need yall to throw some words up
And you dont, and you dont, and you dont
And you dont, and you dont, and you dont
And you dont, and you dont, and you dont
And you dont, and you dont stop
They wanna know the question
K.Dot, everybody stressin
This is the message that Im kickin too wicked, straight from Compton
If you come around my city youll get stomped in
The neighborhood Watts and Long Beach
Boy, you out of reach
This is TDE, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock
Schoolboy Q, we hot, you not
This a freestyle off the top of the dome
Big Boy city, you know my home
Imma represent every time I come to the lab
If you wanna see me, homeboy, get the cab
Cause you cant ride with me, you cant see the streets
You cant see us, its TDE
My homeboy Dave gon fly you straight in
Sippin on that juice and gin and thats a classic
Coming straight from Dre and Snoop
If you want us please jump inside the group
Because you dont deserve it if you dont not
This is straight hip hop, this is off the top
And when I rock you feel it
If its us and then you hear it
Please consider that the best agree
The top number one emcee
Now when I flip it I flip the beat as my enemy
You thought it was taming me, on point like a widows peak
Deliver the bars that everyone agree
They say the number one emcee, best believe
I love the pianos and I love the flow
I love the snare drum, I love... oh, I cant cuss on radio
Because if I do they just might let me go
Im side to the best, I ride to the best
I represent the West, please dont try to test
Because you will get disabled
From best of flows I know, you hate it
Everybody wanna rock, but they cant
Because they come from the street of Rosecrans 
We drop it off the top of the backboard for real
And thats a swish, thats a net, alley oop
I feel that we are the champions and these Godsll stomp you
I come through your block and crash everything that you want or put out to
And if you know my flow then you know how it go
If you know Death Row then you know Eazy, then you know Dre
Then you know Snoop and you know we dont play
But anyway I need yall to flip the beat
Because my words always compete with the best
I said we dont stop, boy, we run hip hop
Boy, we run rap, boy, this is Top Dawg
D-O-T, D-A-W-G, K-D-O-T, C-P-T
L-B-C West, W-A-T-T-S, Jay Rock, he dont play
Niggas and guards, projects
What you want? We can collide anytime with the biceps
But this aint no strong arm, buddy, this just a freestyle
Off top of the brain, boy, you know I get wild
You know Im so foul, you know Im off of the top
You know this hip hop, you know I cropped
The roof from the birth of the Earth
And Ive been doing this since church
With the small slacks, with the soft suspender
If you rapping like that, homeboy, we suspend ya
We contenders, we on the top off the map
We on the top off the globe and yeah this real rap
From the bottom of the soil since Adidas and Run DMC
Sprinting like cheetahs, we run this game and beat me
And man on the beat right now
He gon flip it and please believe
Every 16 bars is like ours
And if you want it then we bout to take charge, whats up?
Tonights the night I jump off my shit
Deep cover on the incognito tip
And every time the words flip the emcees step, but I dont trip
I keep walking, keep pushing and put em in a coffin
You often looking for the best, Im here
We talking, you looking for the stress, you there
Keep walking, you looking for the West, right here
You stalking the flow, you often to know
I want yall to know been doing this since the days of Death Row and Ruthless
Ive been ruthless, the coupe it been roofless
You spit, the words be toothless
But it get like that because you feel it
I got Rikki on my side and she chillin
Big Boy on my side and he willin
They say that he writing my bars, forget it
Its my lyrics, its my pen
Its my paper as I begin
Ive been writing for Kendrick for a long time
And hes been reciting my rhymes
So for those out there who didnt know
Big Boy gets on the mic and he kicks an ill flow
Then about 10 years ago I got this call
From a little dude, I said yes, yes, yall
He said uncle Big Boy, I wanna start rapping
I said whats up, little homie?, he said I wanna start trapping
I wanna start capping, I wanna start hitting the studio
I said slow down a little bit, bro
He said holler, I wanna rock the spot
I said whats your name?, he said my name is K.Dot
I said K.Dot, okay, I think I feel you
But this the way I wanna instill you
First off let me write what you gon say
Record it and then press play
He said okay, it was very rude that I took K.Dot on
He was one of my little students
So he just sat in class
He was looking at me, said do I get a pass?
Do I get an A,B,C,D,E or do I fail?
I said you doing well, his head started to swell
Then all of a sudden he came to me
He said theres this dude in Compton that has TDE
I said  Top Dawg? Hold on, that is my partner
Dont stop right there because I think 
When the dude is coming with a contract
But I said hold on, let me look at that
I said okay, he want this, he wants these points
He want this, but dont smoke any joints
You my lil partna, how old are you on the scene?
He said big boy I been a student, about, Im about sixteen
I said okay keep going, and then all of a sudden
He started doing uhh, he started doing these shows
And he got poetic, he got energetic
Spotetic, all those -etics
Any more -etics, any more edits
Then o-etics, and then a o-etics
So then I came back and he was still in class
And then I gave em that pass
I said TDE, the real Macoy
Cant forget Jay Rock, cant forget Schoolboy
And so I put the whole crew together, but from the background
Before I got in they had a lack sound
They felt like they were laying tracks, for the generation to come. I think my mother knew that freedom wouldnt come in her lifetime, just like I know it wont come in mine. Its a matter of, either we stay like this or somebody sacrifice, somebody laying tracks, so we can stay in a 360 degree. Deadly circle, somebody used to break out and risk, you know losing everything and being poor and getting deep down. Cause someone has to do something, had I had a father, had I had some of these opportunities. I would be able to handle my mother more
I was taught never trust a nigga, far as you can see him
Teach a nigga how to fish, as apposed to tryna feed him
Look a man in the eyes, thats the best way to read him
Cause faces they change, but point of views remain
I got a strange feeling, that Im a lil bit different
Beyond the customs and tradition of a project living
My Korean war vet, grandfathers affliction
Was stress and I inherited his heart condition
And Van Arthurs addiction, was heroin needles
Petty hustling, devils, that street men lust
So Im mixed with that lethal combination but trust
Ive only scratched the surface, whats underneath this verse is
The feeling of a young boy lost, without a purpose
Still waters run deep in the street we were submerged in
Police lurking, tryna catch a nigga serving
He aint going back to jail, so he bust a verse
This is for my everyday young nigga
It dont really matter where you from niggas
Before you leave the house, kiss your moms nigga
Cause you dont know when that dayll come nigga
Cause only Lord knows that I know how you feel
What we gotta do just to live
Is try not to get our cap peeled, try not to get your cap peeled
Its hard to get to know me, unless you hear between bars
Tortured soul self contained on my childhood scars
I was involved from a far, affected by the street laws
Concrete walls, not even earthquakes could shake them brick walls
Nickerson garden projects this is me yall
Where Dope dealers have it all and then freefall
Caine numbs the pain up and down the ghetto seesaw
The voice of the youth, they hear me and they see yall
They dont see a diamond in the rough, they see flaws
They should see how we was raised and they would be in awe
Against all it gets hard not to kill niggas
Its like a full-time job not to grab the semi-auti
And go kamikaze on somebody who plotting
Probably on my body laying lifeless, ungodly sacrifices
To the streets, this is the trinity
Money malice and murder the hoods deity
They say the average black man only lives to 25
Well I made it past that and a nigga still alive
Which means Im in the red, Im indebted to death
Thats the wages that sin pay, Im still tracing my steps
Leaving my footprints in the sand, the concrete rose
That grew on infertile land and blossomed to a grown man
My only fear is pops holding moms hand
Dripping tears on my casket, I refuse to let it happen
By any means avoiding the city traffic
Shooters got the green light, they blocking your right of passage
A young kid turned savage, city madness
A picture painted on the streets canvas, excuse my brashness
Im trying to live to see past this
Staring at the world and my rear view past tense
In no particular fashion, Im on borrowed time Imma grind with a passion
Generation to generation to come
They wont come in mind
Sacrifices, sacrifices, sacrifices
Deadly circle, deadly circle
Uh, oh, yall know what it is
Uh, its that Compton—ish 
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin nights 
Rollin dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice 
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin nights 
Rollin dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice 
Im back at it again
My city back at it with em
Back against the wall, K Dot, they tryna pin
But they can fuck with that pen
The shit I write is brighter than blue gems, uh
You better stay in that gym
Exercise your mind till its strong enough to fuck with mine
Stick to my roots like Black Thought and em
Im black with thoughts of Einstein
One word describing him: genius
What you know about the city I live in?
With the souls of the dead is livin?
You dont know about our living conditions
We live righteously, we can give a fuck about your opinion
But its more than just weed and women
Gangsters, husslers, bullet collisions
Players, pimps, who can envision?
The place where I reside where Eazy was pitchin
Dre was 64 lifting, NWA had mention
Quik had the turn tables mixin
The first ones to say fuck the system
Im tryin to tell you about
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin nights, yeah, homie, thats Compton life
Rollin dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie thats Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin nights, homie thats Compton life
Rollin dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie thats Compton life 
His own street like concrete
Would best describe fit his gutter but see, Im whats underneath
A young gun but not like your young Chris and Neef
Im from the land of organized crime, disorderly peace
‘Cause nowadays niggas hustle when they order their piece
And worship their gun the same as their religious beliefs
The Compton shares cant forget the police
Cause in the hood tellin pigs no more
It be the mark of the beast
And their main aim is just the talk of the streets
But when you see em please be quick on your feet
That they go, watch em!
Had you for road, kill just like a possum
You could contain em, but theres no way that you can stop em
Niggas plant their seeds to be gangstas
Hoping one day they blossom
The same time, hope the system dont lock em
Cause Compton raised niggas and bitches, we barely got em
Unless you talk about the one with the attitude problem
From Rosecrans to Central, Compton Centennial
We back, thats for my people, its official
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin nights, homie thats Compton life
Rollin dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie thats Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin nights, homie thats Compton life
Rollin dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie thats Compton life
Lets bring it back
Back to the streets, of course
Yeah, uh, Compton, right, uh
Homie, homie
I dont know if he new around here
But its good to know somebody if youre new around here
Cause it aint too safe for you to cruise around here
Niggas stick to your ass like glue around here
Take New Jersey and fit it shit, whatever you dont care
It aint no magic trick if they make your shit disappear
The outcome is severe, and some of this casket will last a day
But Im amazed cause the young boy been here for years
Ive seen niggas shed blood blood tears
Hope you not try to plan for the future niggas will mute you
Had your door in the morning wake you up like roosters
Introduce you to rugers
Clock you in like Tap Judah
A nightmare on my street, its Fred Krueger where I live
Minus the actress and the producers
Even adolenscence will shoot you over that paper
We get +Vapors+ like Biz Markie but still Im used to
From Rose crest to central, Comptons Anthemia
We back, thats for my people, its official
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin nights, homie thats Compton life
Rollin dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie thats Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like

Running blind in truth
Ima rain, Ima rain on this bitter love

Ooh, Im telling these tears, Go and fall away, fall away, oh
May the last one burn into flames

Hey, Ima keep on running

Every morning nigga I get blazed ;
Women, weed, and weather nigga if you bored

Girl, what is your name

Little something in your mouth
Little something on your couch ;

Cause I killed it, I done drilled it
She said she like it from the back like a real bitch 
She swallowed my pride, I damn near cried
Yo, I cant reply, she curled my toes and crossed my eyes
But when you got the recipe its no surprise
Bad hoes panties get left behind - I want your behind
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown Im forever living
Women, weed and weather 
Women, weed and weather

Three Ws only for a three day, run
Bitch, take them motherfuckin panties off, you aint no, nun

Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living til I am old
You want to be one
To peak on the chart, so the peons can be gone
And pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon

Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let em know the priority order me
Hennessy and for my niggas OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees

Pretty bitches and tire marks, let em inhale them pipe exhausts

No way hell no, uh uh, if Im wrong I dont wanna be right

That stroke can smoke all down her throat
And we blows all kinds of dro
Cali got the best so act like you know, nigga
Thuggin on other planets, pluckin my black antennas
Listenin for freelancers that bitted my style in famish
I dont allow the cameras, I dont allow the managers
I just break down the answers and hope humanity handles it
This is no radio fluke, this is me takin your food
This is you bullied to school, give up your jacket and shoes
This how I practice the rules, this is what happen when dudes
Like Flying Lotus notice the genius they wrote it is rude
You should promote it, I diagnosed it with viruses through
Microphones hopin the plug is runnin inside of Pro Tools
How can I dodge you buffoons?
I could collide a kaleidoscope with the stars and the moon
The moment I morph in my mood
These are the gorgeousd of tunes
Police reported then tried to sort it with criminal views
This is intentional fuel
For the fireball dragon, fire shots where you wrastlin
AK over the dash and now vacate with the Jurassics
The jungle, the wicked masses, the saber-tooth eighty proof
On my breath, this the look of death, this an antique Mercedes Coupe, yes
Buffalo soldiers at war, you shot fast, but that aint the final score
Buffalo soldiers at war, you shot fast, but that aint the final score

I can never put my plans to the side with ya
I can never see a red light like a deer with a head light
I freeze up when I re-up
See I really have patience
If you relatin, only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it
The reason why I hate to wait for it?
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth, I read the fifth amendment

Pistol whip break the face on you, shit I does it my way like Sinatra
Let them infrareds Dalmatian dot ya
Scopell spot ya, move wrong and I got ya
Through my vision like perennial
Creepin to your house, you hear footsteps slowly as I tippy-toe
The tip I owe is through your window pane, Im insane
One shot could leave em senseless, Marlon Wayans
Psychiatrist cant restrain the mind of a sick patient
Spray everything, not a single bullet wasted
Be patient, you gon be meeting mad links
Put em in the basement
BET, Im strapped with TNT
Follow rules every morning, this bitch coming with me, ooh
Thats what they say when they see me in your coupe
Sunroof, rims spinning like a fucking hoola-hoop
You tried to play big and say gimmie the loot
Tables turned, now the people saying please dont shoot
Get out the way, lady, and try to make it to safety
Cause I doubt that my shit is on safety
Spray niggas, no ifs, ands, buts, or maybes
Ride shotgun, 745 Maybe
Thats Maybach for you dumb motherfuckers
Im wise like my pops but Im young, motherfucker

You want it? They could serve you, butler
Excuse me Ma, I aint going for your lover
So when I fuck you, the same time Im like fuck you
Youre better off looking for your next sucker
Money talks, I thought you heard Chris Tucker
I ball as if I play for the Rucker
Black Widow, keep something under my pillow to buck ya
He talk about it and when the fifth touch ya, no confession, no Usher, for real
Your whole spot is a movie like Blockbuster
If I want you imma bring it to your block, busta
And make it clap, no Im not spliff star and busta
In fact, my niggas is linemen the way they rush ya
I keep it street from Compton to Russia
Rhyme technique is something like none other
Its warfare, choke if you scared, go buy a flashlight and pray under your covers
I slaughter niggas, one hand bang, Vince Carter niggas
Young boy Im a father figure to kids whos minds is bigger
And they pops still sprung off the hardest liquor, Im young
Please move in orderly fashion
For the love of money and crime I got a passion
Blow your body and spine whenever Im blastin
Makeover your whole face, you look like a Jackson
Any one, pick one
Aye

I suggest you cooperate for this tech
Send you to the doctor to operate
You complicate my scheme to get rich
Ill put this heat to your T, let it steam a little bit
Look, when the chips get low, my fifth just blow
Anything that I could pawn, come about that, dog
Its money to be made and if you got it Im taking it
Just run it like a Jamaican and shut the fuck up, nigga
And that might leave more than a rash
Im coming for your ass
Please hand me the cash
Cause when Im down on my last
I gotta re-up fast
Point me to your stash
Dont make me say it again
Before I lay you with Reagan, Benjamin Franklin, and them
Frankly Im a menace
In fact Im ready to blast
So whatever you got, run it
Like a 100 yard dash
Coming for you
Dont let me catch you slipping in that pretty whip you dip in
You would get pulled out
Like my dick in these women when Im finna bust, dont test my clout
Your execution is a must, no doubt
For the longest niggas been taking my kindness for weakness
But this trigger is killing me and Im just dying to squeeze it
Fire for hire, dont let your murder transpire
Thinking you will live forever like a fucking vampire
I arose from the dark to claim everything you own
And theres nothing between us but opportunity and this chrome
It dont take a genius to know I mean this, so ante up
Before I load the cannon up and blow your ass to Canada
Nigga
Im wild with it, pistol whip whoevers in the house with it
Call the cops, tell em like a date, Im going out with it
Give me the goods, give me the hand me downs
Tell your wife to pull her panties down
I need those too, what you gon do?
Dont jeopardize your life, for the nigga hard body made of cement
Plus Im loaded like this clip, off of the Seagrams
Lay you on the floor like granite
Granted your granny watching, Im grinning like I aint just hit em
Better believe it, my heads sort of off, shit
I would have robbed Jesus for the cross if I caught him slipping
God forgive him for this long arm like Pippen
The cars honk but times is hard hard and I gotta eat
Give me the watch, the Sean-John, even your sneaks
Give me your socks, your drawers, your fitted, your Boost minutes
Give me your stocks, your bonds, your blunts, your bongs
Your food in the fridge, your iPod, your celly
You say Im wrong but Im deadly
Thats dead wrong so Im heavy
Like Chris Wallace, regardless
Youre getting stuck up, pussy
Like a tampon with a handgun, push me
But I aint on the swings, I got this infrared beam and it wouldnt miss a thing
Bow!
Chyea! Rose
I got you nigga

All yall little niggas getting your chains robbed

Shout out to Carson, Del Amo, thats where Im from though, DA
You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life dont ask you if youre ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream
Talk about goals
Talk about a pen and a pad and the pad of your house
With a permanent flow
Hennessy on the floor looking at a video on the couch
And the couch is cold
And the pouch in your mama pocket got a permanent hole
And your brother pout cause he want food on the stove
And a pedestal with a silver spoon, and a big pool
With a big room and a closet, cause it
Hurt when you laughing at his clothes
Looking at him like he aint shit
Forever living in that commode
Time flies and I watch it tick
Look in the mirror and I gotta take risk
Like blood on the sheet of a suicide note
Tripod then I aim it at your soul
For bright lights
Bite like a alligator when I write
Hungry, come see determination upon me
Come see the visionary in my sight
My life premeditated by ambition
Pistons from my Nikes take off
No assistance, Im persistent
Adolf, more than I can chew with this thought
You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life dont ask you if youre ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream
Lets talk about pressure
Lets talk about depression
Lets talk about desperate
Times
Everyday Im guessin
My mind, Itll never end up resting
I climb a ladder every second
I find another mountain top
Another video I watch when that video go off
I jot like Edgar Allen, matter fact a thousand
Soldiers never could war off my talents
I wanna reassure my talents
I wipe my face but never throw my towel in
Im often prowlin
The edge of a quantum jump in my head
Im a monster from anywhere but Earth
And Im 1 of 1 ever since my birth, I came for some bright lights
Bite like a bear trap when I write
Hungry, gotta chip on my shoulder
I took it off and ate it
I made it a full meal
And Im still craving, my front teeth
I sink in the rap game
My name will attract fame
My veins got the blood of a king in it
When it pours down, now Snoops on stage and he say
Kendrick
You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life dont ask you if youre ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream
So what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
You can run, you can hide
But when you are chosen
The walls they close in
Your forefathers look you in your eyes
So what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
You can run, you can hide
But when you are chosen
The walls they close in
Your forefathers look you in your eyes
You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life dont ask you if youre ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream
Before I commit suicide, lives will be taken
Mmm, real hip-hop, west coast
Yo, yo
Before I commit suicide
I see to it that a million MCs die, lyrical homicide
Walk up on em, circle the block
Hit em again less than 5 minutes exact, then fleeing the spot
This is Armageddon, two weapons, two palms
Guns drawn, bang! Motherfucker, bang!
One man Vietnam
.45 popper, rhyme like the 9-5 big poppa
On a seven deck yacht, eat lobster with my comrades
Head doctor, knee pads
Gave it to her out of courtesy
Curtains close on that Maybach
Lay back as I hop on my underground shit
Like a subway, derail the track, the real is black
True rhyme sayers, hitmen, crime payers, llama throwers
Hustle in front of corner stores
Street catered, for been living on minimum wages
Its not a threat, Im doing myself a favor
With suicide
Before I commit suicide
Before I commit suicide
Suicide, its a suicide
Suicide, its a suicide
Suicide, its a suicide
I got my mind on the murder and the murder on my mind
You a liar, you and I are not alike
I flow like water, purify mics
Ask Sean Carter, Nasir Jones
Or anyone sitting on the throne
Dont get your career postponed
Women, children, I rode past in traffic
Cant steer, cars crash
I got a death wish, you might be on my guest list
I wrap rappers on stretchers
Guns clap in the direction your sepsis
No matter your gender, not sexist
You MC? You better surrender
I love breakfast, lunch and dinner
Killing these rappers
Sparring in the winter, training in the summer
More practice, lets continue
Doing numbers like an accountant
You wonder like knife, how much money Im counting
Youre damn right, I spit it pretty precise
And whenever the verse is done, means I took me another life
Suicide, its a suicide
Suicide, its a suicide
Suicide, its a suicide
I delete MCs under concrete
Verbal mass destruction, you want it? Then call me
A killer, I put these rappers on their death bed
One shot to the heart, one more to the head
My rhymes so clever I never fall off
From an industry nigga, they all get hauled off
But not from a sawed-off, but more like an uzi
Spit rap, and these succulent MCs get chewed, B
Money, power, respect, pussy and pistols
Hoes pop pills like its a modern day ritual
But I dont sweat em yall, I just behead em yall
And leave the party jumping like players of B-ball
The B-board, those will die who decoy
Destroy any rapper thinking he make noise
Its K-Dot, the terminator
Fake rapper rhyme slayer
Those who live now will die later
The suicide
Yeah, hes got such a pretty face
Hes been calling me for days Ill give him a try
Student body, best in class, got me foolish for that ass
Yeah, Hes one of a kind
First date said I love you, second date met his mother
Now his leaving all his shit in my place
Hes been looking through my phone, breaking in when no ones home
Zero to sixty this boys going crazy
Now now youre out of control now baby
I know youre not in love but I cant get enough
Cause when you go down baby, yes I know now baby
Gotta have a glass of hitch with this crazy ass bitch
Hes a crazy ass bitch
Hes picking fights outside the bar
Slashing the tires in my car, what the hell is the deal
But if we get into a fight, he just turns out all the lights
Then hes got me for real
Third date kept it cool, fourth date act a fool
Hes a feisty motherfucker for sure
God damn just relax, if you wanna make it last
Zero to sixty this boys going crazy
Fuck that, you fucked up, a fatal attraction, good luck
The way that Im reacting to your love
Cupid shot twice, you cant duck
Stupid is what stupid does huh
You probably thinkin Im tweaking off on a drug huh
You probably thinkin Im creeping up on your work place
Tweeterin when you in the club huh?
Straight like that though
Rain on your parade in Seattle
And your mom complain that Im an asshole
Im tryna put it in your unh 
My little tadpoles
Swim, swim, good, left, stroke, right, stroke
I wish we could elope and remote to Rio
Rewrote my vows, I shall devote
Everything I lose and then gain
All I need is your attention
All I need is your now I would go to war
If them papers said to restrain
Hold up
Lookin in your window trying to see what I could find
I dont really ask for much all I want is your time
Everything I lose and then gain
All I need is your attention
All I need is your, now I would go to war
If them paper said to restrain
Strain 
Hold up
I defy odds even if I divide yall
At least 10 percent of my rhythm is arithmetic
Killer with the wit, drench em in the spit
Infrared hot, chillin with your bitch, youre dead right
Youre dead wrong without your dead presidents
Im an old head but Ab stack bread present tense
What part about making money represents you?
Youre on the broke side, I rock your boat ride, dont cry
Get your paper up like hands at my shows
I send this verse through MoneyGram
A hundred grand for my flow
Aside from the fast cars and the chains that glow
Theres gotta be a better way to go
Like them backstreets, ducking them sobriety tests
Blunt in the ashtray, Colt45 on your breath
Fuck what Ab say, I told Carlito its that way
Blow dinero, torpedo through your national bank and
Pay attention, niggas
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it aint funny
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it aint funny
Get, get money my niggas
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it aint funny
Get, get money my bitches
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it aint funny
You probably thinking Im aggravated when I say I foresee the future
Minus the white boy on Final Destination
They say its one Nation under God
But my reality, one person under a gun
And the funny thing
My paper chasing just begun
Still premature and being the black entrepeneur
In this world where we lust for more money, cash and whores
Got me defining life without my high school thesaurus
Blink twice when you see my Porsche headlights
My car is better than yours
I rub it in, like over-the-counter ointment
Youre in desperation thinking that you can coexist
With the immortal vocalist, Ford dealerships aint this focussed
Even when barefooted, the funky rhythm I still kick
Dead presidents is the medicine for my evil heart
More Franks than a ballpark, porcupine sharp
When I dress, when I talk, a dollar bill eject
My conversations about money, what you expect?
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it aint funny
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it aint funny
Get, get money my niggas
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it aint funny
Get, get money my bitches
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it aint funny
Finna diminish any nigga tryna get involved
The fuck they be thinking? Nothing at all
They go against, but still cant float against
No options, flows like a cheese pizza, no topping
Big rig through both lanes, you play possum
You cant see me, flow cleaner than the water made by Fiji
Money clip like feed me, flyer than an airman straight from Tuskegee
Shoot you out the air man, bring your high down
The next morning your hungover from the sober sound
Or the four pound, Soviet Unions in your town
What your homies doin?
Theres some more bullets to go around, now
We can all get paper like Xerox
Or we can just reset Tetris and clear blocks
Or better yet sum us out the money and buy stock
Or call Will to the car dealer and buy the lots
Getting paid period, every hour on the dot
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it aint funny
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it aint funny
Get, get money my niggas
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it aint funny
Get, get money my bitches
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it aint funny

Wee wee wee 
Like a pornstar
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Now they know who I are
I was in high school
Met this little bad bitch
She had all the Jordan shoes
Hair in a ponytail
Earrings bamboo
I said no disrespect
Girl I want a sample
She said, “You don’t know me yet”
I said, “What that got to do with it”
One week or nine months I’m still gon’ hit it
Now admit it, you’re tempted, temptation is a motherfucker
Now let your guard down
I just wanna fuck you
I’m hard right now
I put that on me
She giggled and said, “I’m full of curiosity
Well you know curiosity killed the cat
So as we walk home from school show me where you live at
Walked in, put the rubber on, then I killed that
Walked out, she hopped on the phone, girl he did that
Hm hm
Her friend on the other end thinking how she gonna get a piece of him
Preach
When I get up all in ya
Tell your girlfriend I beat it up

Now they know who I are
Yeah, it’s Ab-Soul
Used to fuck on my momma’s sofa
Them were the good old days but now a nigga older
I think back of when I chased that cat
Like a horny dog, nigga wet dreams and all
Waking up in cold sweat thinking bout them hoes, y’all
No holds barred I would go so hard
Sending bitches notes in class so much I hardly passed
Hoping she give me the mule yeah throw me that ass
I made her laugh
Maybe walk her home
Maybe get some dome
Like Super Bowl Sunday
And then I’m gone
Off to the next
Call her on the phone
This was before text
Carson High we was on them chicks”
Let them play the good role then we make them cake mix
That’s a flip if you didn’t know
Let the homie hit though
Then she tell her girlfriend, then we let her join in
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
South Central, home of the warzone where the great thugs roam
Where we aint promised nothing but shell-bullet wounds and tombstones
Every man for himself in this concrete jungle, jungle
Only the strong survive and the weak perish and crumble
Yeah, niggas pockets hurting, work day and night in them drug spots
In the kitchen with them razors where the water boiling hot
Blood plus crip plus wrong sign equals a shoot-out
Then the Glocks pop then the blocks smoking like a motherfucking Luau
In the projects, watched a lot of niggas, seen a lot of niggas moved out
Then mom said back dreaming of big ass, new house
Then its back to reality, smokers out back getting so high
Watching niggas kill for a salary, watched a lot of great niggas die
Code of the streets, never ever talk to the motherfucking police
If you do better have a bullet-proof vest, better guard your mouth piece
Yeah, I dont really care about what a nigga may say about me
Imma let you speak dollars into my pockets, watch them increase
Look at you - came from ground zero to the top
Made something from nothing on that project block
Switch your hustle, no more working that dope spot
Middle finger to cops, tell em that were legal now
Yes, we legal now, do it for our people now
Finally we eating now, make sure our bellys stay full
We made nothing out of something, man
You know, all the way to the top
Make sure our bellys stay full
Make sure our bellys stay full
Yeah, I got some, but Im still on the block like a nigga never left
Still on the grind all the time, gotta get mine doing whats best
Yeah, I came up, but I never changed up on my niggas, no sir
Let bygones be bygones, let it burn like Usher
No chauffeur, Im wheeling myself in a big 64
Rims poking, three wheel motion, my lungs full of that herb
My niggas still on the curb posted up like junkies at a liquor store
For all my niggas that died in the war, yeah dawg, let the liquor pour
Just Cirocs, baby, hood shit is all I know
Live life to the fullest, never know when a nigga gotta go
Thats how it is out here, dawg, really cant show no feel
Ive never seen a man cry til a man dies, then you see them tears
Rest in peace, Nini, your grandson still looking handsome
Still gotta keep canons cause them haters out there still cant stand us
You said I got power, all I gotta do is grab hold to my pen
Yeah, I love you to my last breath, grandma, til we meet again
Were like a train with no breaks
Who gon stop us?
Make sure our bellys stay full
Make sure our bellys stay full
Yo, Rock - let me get it, let me breathe on it for a minute
Speak for a minute, put my 2 cent in it for a second
Let them get a view of my mind, backpack tucked with a nine
Went to school with it, didnt play with it
Didnt tell nobody it was mine
It was my weapon, had it for protection
I didnt blink, not for a second
Didnt pour my heart and soul to a reverend
Theyre hypocrite anyway, rather put my full faith in God
Had to stay on my grind something like when I was sumping
Had to maintain my function back against the wall, they fronting
Played the background like a movie extra
Extra activities, no remedy for the crime going on, same old song
Bet ya couldnt make it out here if you wasnt wasnt that strong
Not mentally, but physically, had to get my psychology on
Mama said I gotta come home, but I didnt, stayed out real late
My excuse was how we gon eat if its no food on the plate?
Now wait - think back, yeah yeah nigga, far far back
Came from the bottom to the tip top, now tell me how you love that?
Have you ever been punched in your motherfuckin face?
What you say? Oh, you havent? Alright, wait, bitch 
I want the fade 
Give me my fade, I want the fade
I need the fade, I need my-
We gotta fade
Give me my fade 
We gotta fade 
Give me my fade, I want the fade
I, I need the fade, fade
Run me my fade, fade
I cant please everybody, not even me
I wanna please God, but my issues too deep
Bless up, gotta change my number every week
Enemigo, I got em hot, I got em greased
Shut the fuck up, cant you see my daughter sleep?
Shut the fuck up
Servin up a look, dancin in the drought
Hello to the rain man, never losin count
Ventin in the safe house, ventin in the safe house
Can I vent all of my truth? I got nothin to lose
I got problems in pools, I can swim in my faith
Cameras movin, whenever Im movin
The family suin whatever I make
Murder his stackin, the president actin
The government taxin my funds in the bank
Homies attracting the feds when Im brackin
Look at my reaction, my pupils on skates 
Everything jaded 
Team on Go, lets get it 
Green gon grow like veggie 
Casino on my debit 
Fuck your rhetoric, fuck your leverage
Chain no evidence, pass go, motherfuck Confederate
Flags on the back of the medicine
Distributed and peddled in ghettos and
Fuck your heritage, fuck your brainwash
Detergent, internet urgent
Time travel in purges, every man and virgin
Fuck chatterin sermons
Fuck your church propaganda, only God know the answer
We oblige in the cope of state of manic camouflage
Like a sheep so we slide through the cancer, lies and deceit
Vibe like a Phantom, dodgin police and paramedic retreats
Wanna fuck yall up for tellin me Your life was the one I want
Been sellin me concepts ever since I swung
From out of the pro tongue, dedicated myself for recreation
I rest my case, won
Servin up a look, dancin in the drought
Hello to the rain man, never losin count
Ventin in the safe house, ventin in the safe house
Servin up a look, dancin in the drought
Hello to the rain man, never losin count
Ventin in the safe house, ventin in the safe house
Uh, yeah
Ha-ha-ha, ha, uh
I said chilling in my tipi, no Indian but he be
The realest shit, I must admit, Im basking in my feces
My style is harder, yours is watered down, Fiji
The bible or my CD? Both of them are said to be the
Formula to live your life, or coping with the ills
No time to play kid, I think you needs to chill
Houseparty with killers, pray for it to defill us
Where exes think its buffy, and chandeliers hang from ceilings
Im dreaming, Im scheming to be major
Composer like Im Mozart, the sequel to Amadeus
Today is, the day I see the sun, ignoring all the rain
The fat lady has sung, octaves as high as planes
Paper by the forest tree, acres of the THC
I dont smoke but homies do, find a cloud then have a seat
Wonder how Meyer Lansky live to see 80
I just wanna see Mercedes give me head in Mercedes
Knahmean?
And guess what?
I need all of mines—mo paper, mo dough
I need all of mines—more pussy, more hoes
I-I need all of mines—and yeah, publishing, cant forget publishing
Nigga
Just ride, dont ask where we going 
Journey through the sky, cloud nine, no Boeing 
Baby take your time, Ima keep it in control and
Give you what you need and give you what you want in life
I need all of mines
I need all of mines
I-I need all of mines
Just ride, dont ask where we going
Journey through the sky, cloud nine, no bowing
Baby take your time, Ima keep it in control
Give you what you need and give you what you want in life

Dont call them rappers, address them as Bill OReilly niggas
But we gon get them and we kill em, address them as some Hally niggas

When yall was ditching class over these hoes man
I was at Centennial catching fades over dice games
Thats one years ago, 350 days
350 ways, I switch the flow, a hot 
I am a good dude to work with
Destroy your life or destroy these rap verses
Lifes a bitch
So I buy whatever she wants, and hope heaven can be my reimbursement
Milk the game until I see her on the couch roaming this earth surface
At first I was parched, but now Im the thirstiest
Dehydrated
Hungry, frustrated
One of the greatest 
Hey, Hey
Hey, Hey

Then Im back to the hood where they pop toasters

Fuck with caps, its a nail in the coffin
Look, I shoot arms like heroin addicts
Look, a hater shit get drastic

I got the internet going nuts
Bitches hitting me on myspace say they want to suck him up
You want beef? What the fuck is up?
If so when we meet, I got heat for these 
When I spit, the realest will feel something
Thats why I stay on the block, Im still hustling
When you shit on the drop my shit pumping
A spot like a mailbox, its where the bills come in
Me and Hurricane riding in an S5
Snatch a nigga up, take him for a test drive
Tie the nigga up, show him how the west ride
South Central LA, Im a 
Where the best was born
Make sure your vest is worn
Cause niggas will split ya chest when the Tec is drawn
Niggas will split ya deck, then pull your card
Just try to act hard on the boulevard
You know its me in the coupe when Im speeding through
The fiends say I whip colt like a vehicle

With them three, I take over the whole strip
No shit

Crusing through my hood to see whats good

Hubbing a dub
Slugging a snub
Busting at any motherfucker who be fucking with us
This is Watts, California, gutterville, U.S.A.,
Gangbang capital, crackhouses, yellow tape
Riding through the city streets
Cannon right under my seat
Chopper in the back of the trunk, who want it with beef?
Seperate your soul from your flesh if you ever hate
Keep your comments to yourself, watch your soul levitate
South Central LA
Nigga its the place to be
In my house, counting big money is the place for me
Blow good dro, and ride G rides
Gangbanging and cane slanging, the whole nine

And I dont chase bitches nigga I chase after money
Cannibal hungry
Trying to eat till my belly bust

Its boss life nigga
I put it down like Im dropping the habit
Smoke an ounce and get up with more bounce than a rabbit
Got to have it like a crack fiend
Counting big face hundreds till my thumbs green
Interested in major money and power moves
Interfere and get em wet up like a shower do
Thats how we do
Street sweep you when we ride up on ya
I represent that West Covina, California
Sixty-six hit more licks than a tootsie roll
Give me a mic, a bad bitch, and Im good to go
Slow flow

Lyrical arsenal
I heat it up, I like to flame a mic, {Topic loosen up}

Bow down to the realest, nigga pay your homage
In the city of 600s and mostly Chronic, haha, West
And Ima stay clutching, busting the trigger
Talk that shit, fuck around and get ride by us 
Ay, whose back in the Lac on white walls
Big body, the same color as Lysol
Hit the block up, if an enemy turn the lights off
And pull up on the fake ass nigga to turn his life off
Block out!, Block out!
Busting, watch the bike fall
I told em about them self-self made niggas, we aint like yall
We on some other ish
My goons will smother shit
From my Piru niggas down to them Eastside Crips
I thug like everydays my last, ask Jesus
He never missed the beat of my heart, and wont neither
A true leader
In the Ferrari two-seater
Slide off to the spot, get bread, and kick my feet up
Im knocking doors down
When I come around
Better have a nigga cheesey, everybody face down
I represent the city, the home of the Lakers
Inglewood, riding authentic we paper chasing, a Cali Nigga
Here comes a change and another change
And another change and another wave of change
Like a heartbeat coming from another world
I burn, bush on Sinai
None higher than I
Roll up, like that good kush that theyve been smokin since 5
Pull out like 2 9’s and I aim it dead at they eyes
And tell them lyrically motherfucker you have met your demise
Jedi, the black chapter
Like the bone in they thigh been hip to the game niggas lame
I am July working my fire
Know to fucking light up the sky
UFO with the flow, I’m like that alien guy
ET, high power, I three, I see
With it, lyrically niggas never touching us sick
A cell, hard to pass me, I’m too cold they ain’t well
I gel, with black hippie Monáe Janelle
A droid, roid, hemmed in they pit, niggas smell
The shit coming through, silver-back monkey at zoo
Bananas, Ive been really forreally like a milli leroux
East side, now show respect cause the west coming through
It’s like lyrically Big and Pac, man if they friendship was cool
Motherfucking jams we making until the skies turn blue
My view is by Badu sitting at window seats
Lookin down, word to Nate Dogg, and all dog pounds they he peep
We high, touching the sky now and the rest of em sheep
I’m that ba-ba black one now standing out in the heap
Buh-baa, but brag, I part rappers, fingers on Chad
From the rad and so-sos I top, most niggas that lag
Behind, never they catch up like the britches they sag
Close to fallin off, Im in front Im the jag on the jag
Catch up, catch us, good luck like clover niggas now gag
Throw up your 3 for K-dot, now wave em repping the flag
Jamla, camera, I snap like ginger cookies, a monster with stanzas
Stand us, they cant Walker Texas, I’m rangers at ranches
Out of their ranges
Kickin shit up now these niggas can’t stand up
Sit down Im too fuckin profound, Im rap Diddy to strangers, I’m gone
Look into the new vision in mind
Kendrick divine intervention, I drop a jewel and the diamonds glisten
Don’t chime in my business you’ll run into atomic collision
You knew my colonic was different
I’m shitting on shit that was shifting your image
I rhyme like a chemist
I rhyme like the Guinness book of records was records I written
I rhyme and you mimic the rhyme that I didnt like when I did it
You bit it
Your bite is so big you need bridges at night, and 9th can admit it
The pint that Hennessy spiked this minute a mic and a menace
And time is dependent on what you pretending to be
Your grind is diminished by me and mine is the menace the preach
Im findin my soul on this beat definin my flow
And you know I fold any foe at defeat its 4 in the morning
Formin a George Foreman thats a grill when I speak and Im on it
Till the mill in the jeep then living orders
I feel like feets of the fortune of gorgeous of bitches I see when recordin sheesh

Baby, nobody knows a word that you saying
Your breath is reeking like whiskey, what hair you got left is graying
You’re out on my porch yelling, waking the neighbors
Wanting me to come and save you with your aggressive behavior
You’re stumbling all over town, you drink till you drown
You keep on threatening to bring me down
You don’t make the rules, you drunk old fool
See, you don’t scare me, you’re just crying wolf
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy, whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy, whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy
Breaking my door down when I left the lock open
There ain’t much left to be broken
If lies are wet, then you’re soaking
It’s like the Devil just jumped up in your clothes
He put on your shoes and rolled
And still youre scared to be alone
You’re stumbling all over town, you drink till you drown
You keep on threatening to bring me down
You don’t make the rules, you drunk old fool
See, you don’t scare me, you’re just crying wolf
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy, whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy, whoa, whoa, go on and cry, cry boy
Cry, cry boy, cry boy
Nobody knows what you’re saying 
I know the game that you’re playing 
Don’t forget about us, don’t forget about trust
Don’t forget about the kinkiness of playin with the cuffs on a bedspring
Penetrate the loud screams, echo in the hallway is a must
I could never let go if I wanna whore, duck, away from your anatomy
The agony is such a pain I could never endure even if I had the cure
With the pure, sweet morphine touch, I mean, I cannot deny my demise to lies
That interrupted our future, I mean, if I compromise, will you improvise?
Please don’t pin no lies, I’m used to you forgivin and then you forget the truth
I promise that I’ll commit, vamoose to all my old ways
I’m done howlin today, a full moon will never exist, I swear
From the south to the west to the east to the north
It go off, it go off
Blowin Cubanas in Honda Sonatas with Madonnas
As she do the honors to shine and polish my anaconda
Im at the Ramada like Tony Montana with my llama
Countin Angelatas, sippin pina colada cavadas
These giuliani illuminati, my super shotty
These dudesll try me with Deuteronomy, my Ruger body
And my True Armanis, Im prolly with a new crew of mamis
Bout to make a punani tsunami in a blue Bugatti
Flows phenomenal, money on amadu
Diablo chronicles, rap from Elvis Presleys abdominal
Niggas is comical, tryna pair up with the shit Ima do
Gravity rappin fall on deaf ears, Im astronomical
Like a jungle, sometimes that makes me wonder
How I keep from goin under, survivin all of these summers
And runnin from gunners, hoppin out Hummers with Stevie Wonders
That dont even look at who they be shootin when they be dumpin
From the south to the west to the east to the north
It go off, it go off
I slay a nigga with no conscience, Im so Compton
I know your confidence, youre incompetent, thats a compliment
Any continent, I can construct atomic condiments
Im not a Communist, rather govern my own accomplishments
Livin in turmoil boils my temper
Tempurpedicll burn if you sleep on me, nigga
Jimmy crack corn and Kendrick can crack the horns
Of a dragon and toss em inside of a bush full of thorns
Taggin along, get you thrown on side of your lawn
Throw a molotov, I toss, catch it like a baton, boss
Acquire many choirs for your funeral
Be quiet before I stand over you like a urinal
Mark a bullet wherever your latest rapper tattooll go
Your crewll know I split you til you was two adults
Siamese, I sneeze and bless tracks
You a bitch on menopause, I aint gotta pause that
Bitch
From the south to the west to the east to the north
It go off, it go off
Okay now boom shakalaka, Mr. Know-I-Got-A-Lotta
Talkin dollars, Gucci, Louis, Prada, hundred round the collar
Hop up out of that new foreign auto, with the latest model
Tell the waiter bring the bottles, I be stuntin so they follow
This a treat, and Im finna feast, why they send the beat?
Come and see, Hannibal the beast, murder, third degree
I assassinated, flow abominated, know they highly hated
Look how its orchestrated, hottest nigga underrated
They stealin flows, got these rappers so intimidated
New flow, new dough, boy you outdated

Wait til my new drops at the projects
See my sneaks, they aint comin into stock yet
Got the whole hood hooked, no Pyrex
Stay tuned, rose gold on the Rolex

Donatello, green or purple aint no suckas in my circle
Money on my mental, heavy on my grizzle
This aint a movie, theyll rob you for your Dinero
In the middle of the Warzone I be on
Sippin on a big bottle of that burgundy
Muthafuck yo styrofoam
Big barrel, baritone
And It sound like Barry White
And it boom like an eight-o-eight
Turn yo ass to a parasite
On the freeway I rock to the snare
Dont get me out my loop my nigga
A bad bitch I ride with a pair
Like the fruit my nigga
The paparazzi gone shoot my nigga
But I dont pay em no attention, Im a put em in detention
Head of the class, head in the e-class with the tint missin
You said, I know that you said
More company? I probably dont need it
Top of the line wine, Carlos Rossi
Cause Im on some of that
Top of the line wine, Carlos Rossi
Down... When You Could Be.. taking me... down!
Hell nah, hell nah

And your second toe is bigger than your big toe
Chillin in the studio high, puma clydes resting on knees
She keep bbming me get home but Imma fucking G
Girl please
You aint even my girlfriend quit
That type of shit gets you kicked out the in crowd quick
Two fingers together just like yo legs I make em split
She said Im broke. And Hopeless
Yo best friend lemme hit DEST
Last laugh, watch me stack cash
Since you wont let me work file transfer some pictures of that ass
More Kush and wine
Waking up next to two dimes
I smoke one and poke one
They both hell as fine
Well I scooped her up like a spoon
Told her Im June
Good if ya nasty
But I be on my grind so ya cant see me all the time, but when I come baby, I come DEEP,like the trail of tears baby
You understand me?
They told me you stingy if you smoking on anything thats less than a dime
And you miccy if you pokin anything thats less than 9
You live in LA!! and I know In you I found something special
We connect so many levels
But endeavors for the cheddar got me bed-less and you the wettest
I really wish I could be there I wouldnt be jus trynna pull yo leggings
Cause you know my every fetish
And what I love to eat for breakfast
And it damn well eggs it aint Even on the nobodys checklist
BUT MINE
Ill be there in the blink of an eye girl quite whining
Lemme get these dollars
Everyday we back and fourth with the same discussion
Say I act like you aint nothin
Girl you buggin thought we had it clear I aint tryna be yo husband
Them feelings got you wishin it was Somethin that it wasnt
Why you spazz when you here Im in the club from yo cousin?
But she aint tell you she was on me too she be frontin
Man I really shoulda done it, let her blow me like a trumpet
But you be bitchin cuz these bitches in yo ear bumpin gums like

Got me feeling guilty I aint even in the mood to flow
Damn you so predictable sending text wit ya flesh exposed now Im ret to go
When I see that ass girl bets believe its goin down
My woman be trippin sometimes
I remember her strippin off martin and sipping on some of the cheapest of wine
Which way we gone climb? Im tryna get higher but you desire land mines, Blow Up
Every time Im, In Clubs tryna network my social
Life like Im supposed to but Im wrong
To you Im very wrong, but you dont get it, and you wont admit it you say Im like your ex but I think were nothing different
She gave me them digits
But I didnt call, I put that on me
And yo girlfriends, I know they throw salt like Angelina Jolie, now lets see
Ill be gone til Wednesday, gotta show in Portland
Now my baby, say I aint her baby
But more of an abortion Im like thats crazy
I bought that Lexo, and sat it on Jordans
Now miss lady, if promoters dont pay me
Then we cant afford it
Forging signatures on fake check
It aint life if I dont break sweat
To break these mics on every set
Its ironic Im Tryna stay grounded at the same time still fly these jets
Hello, goodbye marro rodeo
Its funny you had a great, but still you took ungrateful
Chorus
Mama said, mama said, mama said
Boy you a star
Livin in a place with a bad mind state
Where a lot of good niggas don’t make it that far
Lot of good niggas didn’t lost they lives
These niggas didn’t lost they minds
For a piece of the pie
Everybody try to get rich fore they die
Uh, fuck any nigga tryna stop mines
Eject any nigga tryna waste time
Bitch you fuckin with a gifted mind
Eat these niggas like pork rinds
Fuck these hoes like one time
But bitch niggas ain’t one time
Seen this shit too many times
So I grab my balls, got on the grind
No I’m getting paid and livin life
Livin life in the winner circle
Cus I suffered much, suffered much
Cold world on color purple
Puffin on that color purple
Pockets green like Ninja Turtle
Turnt up when I’m off the herb
But jump through the hurdles when I use my verbals
Fuck you fake niggas talkin bout
Fuck these lame niggas lookin at?
I’m in a circle full of real niggas
And when I take this bitch you can’t have it back
It’s called hijack, hijack
TDE where the riders at
THC, we got pounds of that
Fuckin around in our circle, riders
We livin life in the winner circle
Ain’t no fake niggas allowed
We livin life in the winner circle
I’m gon make my mama proud
We livin life in the winner circle
Ain’t no fake niggas allowed
We livin life in the winner circle
I’m gon make my mama proud
Life never did seem like it seen some life in me
Lights in the cloud that read, Little nigga just use yo head you might can be
Just like Mike on the mic, Jordan
You’re recording more than twice a week
That’s not enough if you’re nice as thee Eminems
You mimic them legends but your work ethic is quite petite
Everything you like somehow retreat
From the page I’m so impatient
Pacin back and forth my sleeping pattern is getting badder than insomniacs
I’m a zombie at the studio, Can you ponder that?
I soon will blow like an arsonist
All I wanna do is be heard uh
All I ever do is strike nerves 
A lot of fuck niggas and a lot of fuck bitches
That’s one thing that I observe 
Cus when you doin you, everybody seem cool
Til you fuck around, get a blessing
And you look in the mirror, see the same old nigga
But everybody around you stressin
I ain’t ask nobody for nothing
I went and got it my own nigga it’s nothin
And if you don’t condone or respect that
Then step back off my nuts nigga it’s fuck ya
I got a an appetite for more supper
And I lack advice for these suckers
And I sacrifice what I made, God bless my days while I’m in this circle
Ridin
We livin life in the winner circle
Ain’t no fake niggas allowed
We livin life in the winner circle
I’m gon make my mama proud
We livin life in the winner circle
Ain’t no fake niggas allowed
We livin life in the winner circle
I’m gon make my mama proud

And well take that ride
Across the bloody river
To the other side
41 shots
Cut through the night
Youre kneeling over his body in the vestibule
Praying for his life
Is it a gun? Is it a knife?
Is it a wallet? This is your life
It aint no secret
It aint no secret
No secret, my friend, you can get killed just for living in
Your American skin
Yeah
Oh yeah
Yeah
Oh-oh
If I die right before I wake
Cross my heart, then I seal my fate
Life in the dark of the heartless
Looking at the remedy for all this
Everyday they look at you a target
Falling victim, them and
Him and her then this one, insensitivity
Talk bad religion, skin identity
Lack rash decision made by yours
Pack facility with the urban boy
Gun admitted he bear arm
The entity, arm and leg and head made to destroy
80% of the victim was yours
Maybe I get to relive years of war
Look on the corner, we been here before
Look at the momma, you seen tears before?
Pain bright and early
Rain, sleet, hail, snow, worry
More storm barricade the city
Prosecution, unhung jury
These days murder keep em busy
Sweet blood flowed on the gurney
Yellow tape tied around the street
Colin Kaepernick was more than worthy
I could reverse the day, reverse the time
Reverse the block, reverse the gun, reverse the shot
Reverse the law, reverse the flaw
That made us all the versions of a danger flock
Reverse the love, reverse the hate
Reverse the hope, reverse the way we playing sin
Reverse the moment, so we can live again
Life and times of the American skin

Look, A straight up Compton nigga til Im 6 feet
Like Iverson be
Ride and die for mines
Its just me
No side on mines
Because I don’t need niggas switching sides on mines
Childhood friends become enemies
Don’t pay’em no mind
Do your mind like they did Kennedys
Closed casket
Ghetto boys world where we make the murder bracket
High shore taxes
High by the dead beat daddy’s and the mama’s who can smoke the rock the fastest
So he tote llamas middle finger to ya
I never fuck hoes with no condom
Not a high school graduate
Hustlin is where his passion is
Hit the blunt then passin it, hit the bottle then passin it
Hit the gas, hit the brake, hoppin out, blastin it
Where da cash, where da safe?
A robbery’s taking place
Give it to him willingly; he’s killing you anyway because it thrills him
You can almost see his adrenaline pumping
Hey young world we are the children
It’s a young boys world out here
We gotta dredge-it up and down these blocks you got to know
It’s a young boys world out here
I swear to god you gotta feel me
Look..standin on the corner with crack rocks and marijuana
Burner glue, dough and I’m duckin police
In California state penitentiary livin
Feelin like the whole fuckin world don’t love him
So fuck yall
Keep thuggin til the casket drops
Gangsta down to the socks
Wankstas betta beware tryin to be what you not
Just look at his position and the city he live in
Bang the hood like a head on car collision
Bang his tool like a mechanic up under the engine
Knocking on they doors telling neighbors mind they business
Cause 9s can finish off any eyewitness
Don’t call the lieutenant miss Parker he meant it
I’m the author of these delinquents that got you timid
See to you he’s a menace but to me these my niggas
I do this shit for my niggas locked up in that system
Jason head hold ya head
Jewel keep written sentences
Maybe these jail sentences nothing but a young boys demise
And a reminder every time you walk outside
Feel Me, feel Me
Real Talk, whats up
Look, my nigga just had a daughter
Only way to feed his daughter
Said he hustlin harder hope no charges get brought up
Tryin to stay out of gunplay so he see her tomorrow
Back inside the gunplay soon as his homies call him
For that mission again on they mission again
Pop another blue pill then feel relentless again
Waking up in cold sweats see the image again
Nightmares of his victims keep on visiting him
Plus his people keep telling him use your common sense
So he tell’em retaliation is commencing
That’s all they know as a Compton kid
Living only for the moment fuck a consequence
His accomplishments lies deep within
The black heart that hoes be hatin violence
Use violence as his defense so in his defense remain militant
I’m the voice of hell that we livin in
So when the devil got they tongue, I be speakin for them
Talk to me, talk to me
I’m the voice of hell that we be livin
So when the devil got they tongue I be speakin for them
Yung boys
It’s a young boys world out here
I said Im out here baby I said I’m out here baby
If you livin in this life blessed one day at a time
Its your world young boy you can heal or destroy
Make it wrong or make it right
Its your world you decide
Said its yours young boy
Said its yours young boy
Oh oh oh hey hey yaya baby yaya baby
Nod if you wanna be high with the enemy
Its a test of your stamina, do your best
Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby, smoke it up til were high
Tell my mama its bad karma, I just killed a man
Tell your honor he got to pardon me if I hide my hand
Fuck what you heard, this shit is revolutionary
Fuck what you heard, this is the last illusion, bury
Me with the nerve and ninety-five marksmen
So I can shoot this game until my trigger finger jam
I see red flag, I see blue flag
I pick a color, then make sure I dont give you a pass
You call it gang violence, you call it livin mad
I called it life, but now Im like, I fuckin hate it bad
And so we holler, Fuck what you heard
See, we been down for too long
Fuck what you heard, we been tired of doin wrong
If you got the nerve to man up and kill a man
Then man up double time and shake that adversarys hand, bang
Nod if you wanna be high with the enemy
Its a test of your stamina, do your best
Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby, smoke it up til were high
Ah, this for the hatred in you
This is for that place of darkness they have placed into you
This is for the early coffins of those discriminated
Or racially profiled, I can look you in the eye
And make a vow that Ill never make another assumption
That youll never be nothin to me, he fin if you did the opposite
Ill still run with pleasure
Doin you the favour of cuttin through the evil

We partynauseous cause moi seem to have some problem with ya
Prepare, I descend from the West, my name is Kendrick Lamar
We party nauseous cause moi seem to have some problem with ya

Roll it up, baby, smoke it up til were high

On Macklemore winning best rap album
It’s well deserved; he did what he did, man. He went out there and hustled and grinded. Everything happens for a reason; the universe comes back around, that’s how it go.
On the Grammys snubbing him entirely
I definitely feel like they should always have more of the culture up in there, for sure, because we definitely stand out just like any other genre. We part of the world. We part of the movement. So I think any awards, including the Grammys, should always push for more hip-hop because it’s music as a whole, it’s not just splitting different regions. Everything moves as far as sound and vibrations, and that’s how it goes. And we are a part of that.
And no conversation is there
No communication is there
No edumacation is there
But penetration is there
No dedication is there
No revelation is there
But stimulation is there
And the vibration is there
We fuck all night til we see the sun
Backwoods and black Patrón store runs
They call us drones and we both know
Computers in the dark, makin more clones 
She calls me only when its warm and wet
I call her only when I want it
They call us dronеs and we both know
Computers in the dark, makin morе clones
And no conversation is there
No communication is there
No edumacation is there
But penetration is there
No dedication is there
No revelation is there
But stimulation is there
And the vibration is there 
Only wanna push your buttons
You aint a robot for nothin
Let me dehumanize you
I got a new job working on her P love
Trusting the good girl she never was
See, they call us drones
She know how to ride the way I like 
Grips me python tight 
Til I fold
Ooh-wee, baby
You smell that? Now, thats funky
Oh, you say you do? I think you dont
You will? No, you wont 
Thank God for social media
Hieroglyphically, scientifically speaking
I dont know you, but you know me
See, they call us drones 
She know how to ride the way I like
Grips me python tight
Until I fold
And no conversation is there
No communication is there
No edumacation is there 
But penetration is there
No dedication is there
No revelation is there
But stimulation is there
Vibration is there 
Only wanna push your buttons 
You aint a robot for nothin 
Let me dehumanize you 
And no conversation is there
No communication is there
No edumacation is there
But penetration is there
No dedication is there
And no conversation is there
No communication is there
No edumacation is there
But penetration is there
No dedication is there, ah
And you know exactly how I like, dont talk to me 
And you know exactly what I want, dont talk to me 
See, they call us drones 
Grips me python tight
Until I fold
And you know exactly how I like, dont talk to me 
And you know exactly what I want, dont talk to me 
They call us drones
Ooh
She calls me only when its warm and wet
I call her only when I want it
They call us drones and we both know
Bear witness
Watch me get it in like underage club attendants
The roof go back like its vintage
The young boys back to burn your village, the fire touching the ceiling burn
Whats God willing when HOVA retired?
Now he back, guess he got some competition on his hands
Who is that? I...am...
K-Dot, Im claustrophobic dont put me in the box with you niggas
You cant categorize me
Im already convinced that Im the hottest nigga out
Any comments? I thought so
You niggas is gassed up like ALCO
Scared to play Madden on All-Pro
Step your game up
Im here to fuck up niggas barcodes
SoundScanll never read your albums again 
I take 99.9% of your fans
The last one left is your moms 
Aint nothing gifted about you
Put a bullet in you, tell a doctor get it up out you
Im bout to, send him right there, he shark food
Piranhas is coming I put beat on you rap dudes
I dont wait on you rap dudes
Nigga NASA couldnt reach my altitude
Skys the limit, and your body aint airborne...
Is it? Are you?
My real niggas, once again its on
Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
I kick up destruction and when Im done
My city blow them horns, it sounds like...
When they blow dem horns Im coming
Torch in hand, yes, Im running
I told Jay Rock, I like red too
But you gotta kill these niggas out the blue
They dont see it coming
Who aint a part of the family tree
Do em like Paul Bunyan, axe about him
We travel like an ant colony, you cant count us
Sip Henny til my throat drown
New Benz, No Malice
Count money til our hands get calloused
40 caliber in the Cavalier, welcome to Los
Angeles, you might leave with bandages
Real life, no mannequin
You pull out, no panicking, you better shoot
Or have something fall on your rooftop, no raindrops
Im talking bout gold bullets and black suits
No magician, no magic, POOF
Closed casket fatal attraction
Son, three hit you like John Paxson, I aint bull-shitting
Them veterans been loved em
Talk about bars I got a life sentence of em
And Im just like spitting cousin, ciao
No man get the best of him
The way I see, why rap?
Im just wasting my breath
Yall dont hear me
Im just chasing my death
Its all over, the ends here so Im pacing my steps
Try not to recollect what I know
These pregnant quotes meaning, they give life like semen
Be the reason my hearts bleeding
Im coughing up blood in my palms as I recite the book of Psalms
Over a slow clap and kick drum, wis-dom
The application of your knowledge is me
Pay your tuition, this verse is like a college degree
Yall dont hear me, yall fear me like a doomsday prophet
When Im focused, nothing under the moon can stop it
I leave you off the Earths surface, thats what you get
For trying to test my patience like nurses
This aint a verse this is a Kennedy curse
Put your brain on your ladys purses, you niggas crazy
My real niggas, once again its on
Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
I kick up destruction and when Im done
My city blow them horns, it sounds like...
When they blow dem horns Im coming
Torch in hand, yes, Im running
My real niggas, once again its on
Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
I kick up destruction and when Im done
My city blow them horns, it sounds like...
When they blow dem horns Im coming
Torch in hand, yes, Im running
Yeah, Kendrick Lamar, tone what up,check it out
As the day go I let the beat rock
Then put my thoughts inside the cradle, hip hops
God Father plant the seed, you should be my son
And if you niggas hot, I guess I am the sun
Im a degree away from global warming, this a warning
Shot like I knew Big but Im enormous
I hear an Instrumental then I turn to Norman
So go tell ‘em I killed it you fucking informant
I’m always performing
Like it’s my last morning
Before I sit with the Lord and see my mother mourning
I’m in the air with it like a new pair of Jordans
Ground level never been important when I walk the earth
Walk to church bishop said he lost his Bible this time
Told me that he need a verse, I blessed him with a couple of lines
Bear hugged a few bears, wrestle with a couple of lions
That’s the imagery I delivery when I fuck a rhyme…
Fuck off, Kendrick Lamar
Jay Rock motherfuckers you know what comes after that
My town I rep it till im off this map
Watts City, Eastside baby
Chillin in the bricks with bricks looking for fifty
It’s still in my blood, nigga it’s all natural
Welcome to L.A gangbang Capital, Still rocking my colours I wasnt sworn in it
I aint a millennium baby,look I was born in it
Bless the beat when I speak everytime, cocaine bars that tweakin off every line
I’m in deep space now when I write, no pen no pad in my mind when I write
Flow bolder than a cold on a polar bear, shhh im the one that this rap niggas fear
You can’t do me, this game’s like an ocean catch a nigga floating on the top like a boat…Rock!
Lil Watts lil Compton in the dash of the East
Kendrick Lamar, Rock, and Tone put you back in your seat
A natural beat
Got me like a savage and beast
The rap game start to look like an immaculate feast
Im back in this piece
So listen when the package complete
Join the cause or hit the hills when disaster released
The passion in me
Got me spittin accurately
So the realest MC is what I happen to be
You can vibe wit it or move back
These new jacks gettin blue black
With boom bap I proved that
Know my Golden State affiliates can prove that
On my menace shit Long Beach Venice shit
Primitive the way I crafted this all the penmanship
Its intricate now go and start the sirens
My microphones on the flow is sparking violence
We the best duo out since Bo and Marcus Allen
Hey, welcome to DA nigga
I really thought I was a drummer for a second there
Follow me home, see where I was rose
Like the one in 2Pacs song that grew from the concrete
Half a line in Del Amo on cross streets
Baby baby mommas strappin babies in carseats
Niggas failed art class, still theyll draw heat
Design a murder scene faster than an architect with a masters
One out of three niggas you know slang, thats a accurate fraction
Sunday dinner denim for packin a mac in
Cheese in the pockets of potential rocket scientists gone bad
Like good girls movin too rapid
Had it not been for the social status we after, our
Minds couldve been on more than after hours
Some of us become legends, some are labeled as cowards
Others fall in between, I say Im a king
Now you can disagree or kiss the ring
Either way niggas kneel to my feet, dont be late
And if you make it in time to hear the trumpets, I
Know you gon love it cause I love it
Whats that?
My city blowin them horns, it sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
Who wanna go 15 in a Del Amo park alley
Used to battle with the pep rally
Rest in peace Prospect, I miss you like a missile
I can vision you blowing up
I launch it in your memory soldier
Ask capital Z about snap capital G
How we used to wear triple As and Footlocker Ts
Two toned fitteds from swap meet
Prepaid Nokias would light up antennas at the AMC movie theater
Back when the bitches wouldnt holler
I was short 75 cent, he threw me a dollar
Cant forget J Silk, my ace boon coon
On me JT wouldve been proud of you
We used to mob to McDonalds every day after school
Or Shakeys for pizza if our allowance would allow it
I was wildin saggin with the crips I had no business
I learned, job or no job your ass better be with the business
I became an alchemist over instrumentals
Im Jim Dear over here, thats the mayor say your prayers
Its C-A-R-son, daughter, father, mothers own
Turn my shakin haters off and Im right at home
And if you at home with me and hear the trumpets
I know you gon love it, cause I love it
Whats that?
My city blowin them horns, it sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
How you like your stay so far?
Is it all its cracked up to be?
If you ever caught the Carson Circuit
Ditchin fifth period to hit the mall, then I hope you hearin this
I do this for yall, cause yall can relate to me, youre my family
If you went to Cheapwood, Frog Acres, or Banana Lee
And still hit the ARCO on Del Amo and Central for gasoline
Chances are we know each other well
Not the one for wishes or for fishes, more like good
If you touched every Carson corner I once stood, then would you
Just open your ears and hear the trumpets, I know you gon love it
Cause I love it
Sound so beautiful, dont you agree?
Really feel like, really feel like Im the king of Carson right now man
For real, nothing yall niggas could tell me
Dont lie
I know what you dream about at night
With all your might
You carry them inside you all your life
I got the scars of a lion walking through triumph
Survival tactics, I practice
Survival tactics, I practice
Survival tactics, I practice
Survival tactics, I practice
I got the scars of a lion walking through triumph
I got the scars of a lion walking through triumph
Survival tactics, I practice
Survival tactics, I practice
Survival tactics, I practice
Survival tactics, I practice
I got the scars of a lion walking through triumph
Oh...Oh...Woah...
Oh...Oh...Woah...
Take care
Not to get to much blood in your hair
I take my time
I get to carry these ones on my life
Oh...Oh...Woah...
Oh...Oh...Woah...
Uh, I got the scars of a lion walking through fire
To chase and face my desires Im racing till I expire
Aspire to be the great
The greatness is within me just pending until its escape
The feeling is splendid its fibbing and beating the case
But wait theres a splinter in the splendor cause you just Cant
Please everybody and your adversaries want you to break
Thats when you look at yourself in the mirror and then you say
Its me myself and I and Imma try even if they hate
Try offending anything I confront and give my heart to the people
And turn my back on the government put my all in this music
Survival tactics I practice I keep my eye on the Judas
Counterattack with compassion
And Loriana is my angel, yeah Loriana is my angel
Wish I had heaven on earth to personally see your halo
Sick of feeling like God picking on me
Scarring all the stars in my galaxy
Soul!
Ladies and gentlemen

Black stronger than Hancock
Hand on my cock
Fucker
The Los Angeles pitbull causing the racket
Serena Williams couldn’t even seen him in tennis practice
Fuck with the man/wolf reekening your possession
I stare at the moon and then howl no question
Homie!
This is the part where you spaz out
Like if a nigga spit in yo mouth
Or called your momma a bitch
Now that’s some ignorant shit
I’m a ignorant nigga
Think of Bernie Mac & Richard taking pictures with ya
With the brain of a million geniuses
Fuck you, with a million penises, no homo
Fucking faggot
You sucking dick and Im laughing to the bank, Bob Saget
Give up the chips and make the life with paralyses, chaos, havoc
Boycott who evers the best, including Khaled
I pray to God you love your success cause when I have it
You’ll never get a piece, I lay careers out in the streets
If a meteorite had hit me, I be good in a week
If a alligator had bit me, I bet hed break his teeth
It’s Mandatory
It’s Mandatory, my dude
You a square beyond squares like a rubix cube
I would probably kick your ass but my shoes are glued
To the peddle of this vehicular Porsche I move
It’s Mandatory
It’s Mandatory, bear the glory, of a warrior, warriors state out will kill you for me
One man man slaughter tell the world to record me
I don’t care if he’s 76, I’ll get to him shortly
I ain’t lying, been a john since a nigga was a shorty
Young nigga smoking bub, but I’m wise like a 40
Aye rappers
You rappers are papier-mâché
Meaning I could build you up & break you down the same day
It’s Mandatory!
It’s Mandatory my nigg!
Word, sentence, paragraph, story my nigg
Fuck-niggas must fuck niggas
Cross genders
I’m psycho on the microphone
Pick up niggas
It’s Mandatory!
Now get me some more of that beat
Hol Up!
I got it Ab-Soul let me go sea floor deep
I’m C4
You a fool if you don’t pick up your heat
Then Bonsoir
Bombs away nigga, bon appétit
I’m Rodney King as I endure beat after beat
Week after week, like you & him lifting weights in the streets
I do my thing and take a breather, then come again
Aiming for your temple like a preacher, as I sin
Its Mandatory!
Lyrics From Snippet
Woman arrested for gettin naked
Barrel straight through the peephole
Tell your parents that we home
Propaganda that we own
Crime infested, not contested
Block conventions and street zones
My redemption wont be long 
My religion, fear no man 
Warrior, Conan, oh man 
Horror stories and romance 
Devils that like to slow dance
Kettles burnin with sin in them
Children dont wanna hold hands
Tourists dont wanna visit and purists die in the maulin
Fire burnin through skylines
Follow fortune through guidelines
Bloody Jordans and Popeyes
Stolen Porsches and baby abortions at an all-time high
More divorces and child support lawyers, callin you, Dada
Feds tap on your wifi 
Meds makin you crazy, you dip your head in some agua
Hit the dip while youre drinkin it
Fuck it, flip on the stop sign
Duck a clip in that drive-by
Fuck a bitch in the Honda
Sell a brick to a minor
Makin wishes for Jannah
Pump your fist up far higher
Reminiscin bout Zion
Tigers, bears and lions in every jungle that I am
Welcome to Americas future, the great ruler 
Public Enemys first born, ready to shoot you
I hate when people at me
Im hurt, so, nigga, dont at me
I dont need the hype
They call me- fuck it- I dont need no introduction
No ad-libbing my name 100 times for nothing
You already know its K. Dot, city of Compton
Analogy is like Biggie and Bed Stuy, Oakland and 2Pac
Im more focused, Im nothing like you new guys
Struggling over a few lines thinking you hot
Cause your homey said you you was a few times
Which is too many times, they lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in a booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hrs, you niggas better get your bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key
My cool is on, she love my A/C
My juice is on, and I wish one of yall try to rob me
I shoot, and how have you laying between the sheets with the Isleys
I push the coupe like a high speed
The helicopters come and realize that nothings behind me is behind me
Your honor, I fuck over this beat with no condom
This aint rap its really a porno re-winded back
Finally the finest of em all is back
To define the laws of crack
Yall dont obey, yall aint nice, yall just OK
Youre nothing more than a little John phrase
Im Mike Jordan in his prime
Modern-day Issac Hayes, theme song to Shaft
Equivalent to the theme song to your career, study my craft
You ignorant: I do it without a pen and pad
Just inspiration: something you never had
If my pockets is something you trying to grab
I pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab
You old news, you old dudes get out of my way
Let the young boy come through; dont mention my age
Im on a mission for pay
And you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
But actually you aint accurate fucker with this music biz
The industry like, Fuck it, let the music be his
No theme park, Im not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water
Do he really fuck with President Carter?
My reply is that I cant stay away from the bosses
Had the bidding war popping like an auction
Nine or 10 labels like what he hitting for? 7 zeros or more?
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my porch
But money was barricading my door, I couldnt open it
Money on my passenger side, now who you rolling with?
Black diamonds, not no rose-gold shit
Teamed up with Watts finest
Jay Rock wont you avalanche these niggas so I can rock-climb em?
Bring em back to me, the 56 rap bully is back for the first time, killing you niggas
I hope you got nine lives, its not Nas or Jigga
But where Jigga left off that is where I pick up
I got them holding their breath without having no hiccups
Screaming, Fuck the world with a capital F
Real niggas: we the last ones left, MY NIGGA
I raise the bar for rapping the West
So have your shit up to par if you rep for the West
Cause you see homeboy, we aint getting respect
So we got to get it back, take it back, to the Jheri curls
And the Raider caps, my khakis on
Address the issue in my last three songs
Man, Game know about you West Coast clones
And nigga we hate twins
Put some change on it, see if it makes sense, ya know
I got to be the new breed top 5 minus 4
Thats number one, cause second is the first loser
Dont beef with me homey, if you want your future
Rap aint promised, you might think its slamming right
But look at Onyx, they aint too tight
Interscope consults it: look at Suge Knight
Im trying to get money like the Oasis
If you aint on the same shit like my gold Ds, keep rolling
I keep rolling, never stop
Top Dawg Entertainment: Presents K-Dot
Right
Child of the ghetto, nobody explained to me
I learned from the streets no picture was painted for me
This niggas is frauds not what they claiming to be
Got my 9 11 niggas with me, they craving for beef
Let the chopper sing to them like Frankie Sinatra
High-school nigga, probably got shoved in a locker
This for my niggas up top getting ready for lock up
These rap niggas weak, x em out like a pop up
Known for making movies, give them an Oscar
Fucking Lo junkie, part reason why they stock up
Whole hood through the show, spending cake to watch us
Come home to you Kush God on the knockers
Ah, you fucking right
Just another day another hard laying night
These fucking weirdos, these niggas aint bright
Playing around with DZA ball game, riiiiight
Im on my way, real on cake
Wont stop grinding till my crew all straight
I do my dude dont make me loose my cool
Knock them out the park
What you wanna do niggas, its ball game
Thats a ball game chump, ah
Ball game, nigga, the ball games done, right
In every inning sure your careers ending
You niggas aint winning, really youre short winded
The bases is loaded you ever notice
Your spot in your game was took, as I look at your team choking
Sore losers never can play us, a chin bruiser
Send shooters on your block scurting off on a scooter
Im raising my stock with every hit record, look at my record
Your status will drop soon as they message me in the session
Minor league coaches we feed them bitches to vultures
You posing as a poser, we post your death on a poster
Your highlight is getting closer, to stardom we never start em
We starve em and tire mark em, in the dust so you can watch em
In God trust, Im probably tied up with a cheerleader
Just your luck you fucked around and let a queer lead ya
Times up, you play softer than Damien
We aim it at your cranium and leave fragments over the stadium
Im on my way, real on cake
Wont stop grinding till my crew all straight
I do my dude dont make me loose my cool
Knock them out the park
What you wanna do niggas, its ball game
Thats a ball game chump, ah
Ball game, nigga, the ball games done, right
HiiPOWER
Sox Gang
Im wearing black pumas, hair like Kunta
Kendrick Lamar
Bout eight of them in the studio
And the all want me
Fuck you niggas bruh
Skeme whaddup
If I come off as unconcern, please forgive me
I aint even poured the sizzurp yet 
Im on this remy, if my phone going straight to voice mail
Bitch Im busy, I aint got the time to talk
Every tick Im repping my city 
Ten bottles at a time, this here is the life
And how Im living might be wrong
But in this world what the fuck is right
Its just one rapper, 2 cups, 3 bitches blowing me
Heard its 20 niggas in the VIP, then bitch you know its me
Im here for niggas go and do them bizz
Getting tired of hearing rappers just rapping the shit I live
All that I got is my all, thats exactly what I get
And I need my toilet paper every time I do my shit
Guess I should switch, cause Im getting paid
Instead of worrying bout how Im getting money, just do the same, bitch
The bright lights and people screaming my name
Fuck the money and the fame, bitch thats the reason I came
I remember why we dont fuck with none of these niggas
I remember, I remember why we dont fuck with none of these niggas
I remember oh my, how the times change
Nothings the same, but still remember why I came
Oh my, how the times change, getting change
Now everybody knows the name
Oh my, how the times change
Nothings the same, but still remember why I came
Oh my, how the times change, getting change
Now everybody knows my name
Driving on a freeway full of darkness
Its just me and plus my heart is cold
As an project carpet
You be coughing up commode
Full of shit see I was told
That only real niggas can harvest any future pot of gold
And look at you, I know you starving, see its burning in your soul
And you look for me to console your emotions
Im on the road and Im joking with all my niggas
We laughing at you the feeling of victory is a gig
And I hope they catch you whenever you fall from the pedestal you was on
And dont get me wrong, you was in the zone of a lifetime
But the place you belong is the bottom
Thats why I got a bullet for every ego or tuxedo
And some scenos, a combination that we know
Uh, tight rope, but I notice they walk a thin line
From having the disabilities of deaf, dumb and blind
Every time I recline, then remind myself
I would never die with pussy, less it was on my dick, pussy
I remember why we dont fuck with none of these niggas
I remember, I remember why we dont fuck with none of these niggas
I remember oh my, how the times change
Nothings the same, but still remember why I came
Oh my, how the times change, getting change
Now everybody knows the name
Oh my, how the times change
Nothings the same, but still remember why I came
Oh my, how the times change, getting change
Now everybody knows my name
Staring out a benz window, thinking bout saying fuck it
I make it and spend it all
Middle finger for a budget
Got your rent off in my pocket, and spent off a piece of luggage
Got a lot of bad habits, with money, some shit Im stuck with 
Nothing but dollars in my discussion, show my ass out in public
Cause motherfuckers love it, I hear 
Niggas out here plotting on the come up
I hold this gun up, then one of these coward niggas run up
My nigga dead, so for him Im lighting my blunt up
I say hustle for this rap bitch, Im getting this from sun down to sun up
I know its niggas hating, praying I never make it
But jealous pussy Im here, and Im never leaving just face it 
Before one of these niggas take me out this motherfucking game
Promise I do my motherfucking thing
Do what the fuck I want, motherfucker lame
I just keep it 100, fuck breaking down for some change
Nigga I just stay the same
I remember why we dont fuck with none of these niggas
I remember, I remember why we dont fuck with none of these niggas
I remember oh my, how the times change
Nothings the same, but still remember why I came
Oh my, how the times change, getting change
Now everybody knows the name
Oh my, how the times change
Nothings the same, but still remember why I came
Oh my, how the times change, getting change
Now everybody knows my name
Welcome me, come to me now
Help a king
I need assistance, Ive been on hiatus
For ages and now Im missing
My U.S. love
Yeah the home of the Beyonces
Or the lease and Alicia Key to my place
Tango a la Congo, per se?
Straight up out the jungle and Im feeling lonely
Im going to the land where they got the milkin honeys
So lets flip a coin, see which city we goin
L.A. or Miami, no matter long as its sunny
It be cold in New York, I heat it up
Baby, strip, Im blowing all of my bucks
Forget about Houston dough with the Houston flow
Purple swag and Im moving slow
Circling a nigga named Prince
Cause he got all them Houston broads
Loving girls in America
I love them girls in America
Me and my driver will march all over your party
We crash up your club and we dont say sorry
We dont play with Arab money, we play with that safari
But you know I am a prince and I give a damn...hardly
We coming for them girls in the cities
You better tuck your girl or shell come with me
This is Kendrick
I touch every city that I touch down, score
Endzone more
Rozay watch role play, 10-4
Tap that, baby, O.J., oh boy
Magnum glove, Im sorry judge, but every pretty girl
Wanna fall in love, Im Akeem, Prince of Zamunda
Shine like a jeweler
One railway from a high beam
They like me too
I am their type: crazy
ATL, NYC, AZ, MIA, LA
They say he turned up, you damn right
She 25, I call her life
I call her sex, you call her wife
And that aint right, ya hurrd me?
Forgive me lord have mercy!

If you got trees fire it up, fire it up
This is for the Gs, and this is for hustlas
This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gs
Free packed intro, tech with a muffler
Bring it on you busters, watch you niggas flee
Hes making a killing off putting his life on Pro Tools
The new school, the rap version of Aaron Jones
The hair and bones
To rock Jane, to cocaine, to spit game
To get us, they get tucked
Nigga dont get gassed up, might get blast up
It aint about being tough, but even in them interviews
Every time you see me got a semi in the tuck
Chickens at the label like leave the gat at home
You know those Hip-Hop cops got it in for you
They got it in for us, but they aint bending us
We got a infra strong enough to flip a code
Niggas want beef ride up
Then Free hit ya niggas squad up, squad up
Then my niggas squad up
If you got trees fire it up, fire it up
This is for the Gs, and this is for hustlas
This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gs
Cops trying to cease my beans
No nice clothes were caught in the morning
Trying to crease my jeans
I remember me as a young buck
Trying to put work in
Same pants for two weeks
But I would iron the dirtiness real
Back then the battle was urgent
Now days you see me in the same shit
I didnt have the detergent
Im riding Six and Park
You used thought you knew like the back of your hand
Turn around and give the glove
So I learn to stay with you
Cause when your wheels look like Terminator 2
Itll turn your man into a hater, true
Hopefully the pain will stay past then
As whats to come, its better that what has been
Think about it, but if his problems keep playing, solvem
Joey and Freeway, still hood, still starving, nigga
Niggas want beef ride up
Then Free hit ya niggas squad up, squad up
Then my niggas squad up
If you got trees fire it up, fire it up
This is for the Gs, and this is for hustlas
This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gs
My big Unc still fucking with customers
Greyhound not in town, moving them keys
Hoopty or V12, Im moving them keys
Niggas know me well, cant move me with ease
Go in your pockets at, take all your cheese
Thats how I make my profit, rob yall when ya sleep
Its the black Clark Kent, Superman of this rap shit
Play Superman when them gats spit, and them Kryptonite hollowtips
Make you backflip, then chaperone you to a casket
Its real
Goddamn, theres no man like I am that can compose the skills of a genius
Im not Hip-Hops future, Im Hip-Hops Fred Krueger
A new nightmare, Im right there
With the head of Lucifer killing you demons
Gods children, what can you do to us?
This rap shit aint new to us
Been real, since Mama was stroller scootin us
Yall better get used to us, Im my own scout nigga
How you recruiting us?

Hub City Threat
Minor league year
Freeway
Budden
Jerk
Tell em, ok
Tell em I got plenty hustle to sell em
Heat by the fleet, displaying it very seldom
Lead how right to light ignite my cerebellum
Close to the pen like I had three felons
Come from a city where niggas show no remorse
And the corpse is just another homie taking this course
Of course my dream was to play in the final four
Til the twelve grade came and I was only five four
So Now I’m a graduate, looking to get higher
My pops knew a security job, he inquired
But ignorance is bliss, thats what I was told
I stop, drop the role when somebody else fired
Now there goes another black boy unemployed with a lot of free time
Which means he’s hungry or just a lot of free crime
I lived it in my rhymes, and when I hit the porch, this is what I realize
Wassup
Chh- 
Bounce, bounce Uh, uh
Bounce, bounce 
Ha!
Sound like some more dynasty shit
Feel me go
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Turn this up
Im a soldier mane, thought I told ya mane
I aim and flame ya, Im the pro-to-pane Ahh
Niggas sizing me up like Im buying a tux
So I interrupt, crease em, iron em up
With the nina, not talking bout the two singers
Cause a leprechaun wouldnt even press his luck
Im sure to pluck any chicken with a rhythm I could fuck
I tell em call me up
Like is it on or what?
Can I cut til dawn, or what?
A slut say she want a slice of all of us
Intelligent, say her marbles marvelous
She go down south like black colleges
Im a psychologist, I tell her I can adjust
Anything in the world that be bothering her
Everywhere I go, guarantee she go
Pussy pop on the low, like a silencer
Back to the realest shit, cop a car, mash that
Crash that, then Im back at the dealership
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds on my left wrist
Diamonds on my right wrist, damn it Im the brightest
Back to the realest shit

Niggas aint raw, you grillin

Barrage be intimate, a massage beginning with
Caress from her tongue, deep throat raw
Lots of trauma, your baby momma
Brain is crazy—Jeffrey Dahmer
And Im finna shoot—like a dirty llama
Big truck kicking up dust—conquer
Chocolate seats—Willy Wonka
Passenger—Pretty Woman
Direct a fact—bring your compass
You bringing Carson—you bringing Compton
Yall bring the nonsense
We bring the real, like Pro Tools, never gross 500 mil
And we out in Brazil, in the green like Blanka
Bonkers—tell em Top Dawg is here
Back to the realest shit, cop a car, mash that
Crash that, then Im back at the dealership
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds on my left wrist

Whatever war you bring, just send me to Iraq
I rap like my tongue was sitting on a match
You struck by lightning, frightening, gotta be a Heisman
Trophy, low-key, the one and only
Slay a ho, play a ho like a oldie
Yup, and Im dope like Opie
Um, so Im out when the police
Come, like a nut, Im a nut
For the bucks like a shotgun bust, and I bust
Venom inside the brains of young dames
Like Mr. Dash speaking to his kids on Jay-
Z—We runnin the game
Yall slipping like run in the rain
Ya bitches running away from yall to us
In God we trust, at yall we bust
Back to the realest shit, cop a car, mash that

Weezy Up, K.Dot
The homie K.Dot, he crazy too
Love
I cosign this, shout out to my homie Jay Rock too, hes my nigga too
Your nigga? Shit
Youre my homie Im telling you
I co-sign it
Growin up I was a knucklehead
Boy you never listen to me!
Thats what my momma said
Im from the projects
I aint never had shit
Me and my older brother
We had to share a mattress
No heat, no lights
Had to keep them candles lit
My daddy left me at 8
In an out my life and shit
Gang bangas dope dealers replaced my father
Neighborhood hustlas taught me to get them dollars
Thats when I became a problem
Product of my environment
Its hard to grow up be a doctor or a fireman
When you constantly seein that g ride tires screeching
And them shots firin all the time it happens frequently
The hood inspired him, to be a G
I bled for the game did it all for the letter B
The big homie gave me the name jay rock
This aint no rap gimmick
Its a real life story on watts livin nigga
You can take, me out the hood, but you cant take the hood out me
And thats the way it will forever be
And I can’t help it i’m gutter
Why should I change now
When all my life I been gang banged out
That project shit run deep in my veins now
And I can’t help it
Ooh my lord knows that I can’t help it
Let me take you on a detour
East side watts
Niggas will go in projects
Follow me home to my black and white apartments
Police roll thru with caution, scared to death
The homies got tats across them
Capitol BH over they necks
Since birth banging the set
Even the hoes banging the set
Some aint, but most is hood rats
That looking for that buck
Them trash cans lay in the street
Ghetto technique for drive bys
For the low them 5 dollas will get you high
Dice games, YGs, fist fights
Six fos, el cos, g rides, and mini bikes
Might see a couple of zombies late night
Off what? off pipe membrane dead right
No lie something in the bushes
Either the AK or the .45, no lie
Raised in the ghetto
With rats and roaches
Smokers on porches
Getting high off yola
Its colder north
But my citys the coldest
Where we aint promised to see the morning, nigga
You could take me out the hood
But the hood will never leave me
Im still bangin
Im still hangin
The only difference is
Im not slangin
Nickels and dimes
More like slanging these rap lines
Verses of truth
When I step in the booth
Niggas know I pour my soul out for the struggling youth
For that fatherless son who needed love so he ran with a crew
Grew up before his older brother did
Gin and juice
Replaced the pain I knew
Carrying them thangs to school
Them niggas was tripping I wasnt bangin the blue
But they had to respect me
I never ran from who?
Nobody, put my faith in god
Its amazin how I overcame them odds
On my momma this past year my life has slightly been revised
But notice I said slightly
Cuz me being absent from where I came from
Thats unlikely
Once again its on
Im the youngest in charge, I am not playin
I fear no man else than God
Scatter your features, give you a face collage
Not one, but two, I face menage
No hands involved, mommy would rather give a mouth massage
General, you can call me the sargeant
$7.45, five percent tip
I know Im the shit, please hold the applaud
I spent summers writin rhymes, winters freestylin
Daydreamin Gilligan thoughts on an island
I didnt develop, I was born with this talent
Brain swell up, whenever you come to me you were the challenge
I need a way to balance street shit from the rap shit
Stay on my toes, feet grounded to the souls of the dead
But still bulletholes surrounded the arc in my feet to the crown on my head
Preach, listen how I pledge
Ive been gettin this money since you dummies were peein in bed
To poppin wheelies on handlebars and pegs
To poppin Big Willy at the bar with bread
Pause, its real talk, I know you gotta crawl before you walk
Shit, I decided to jog
Im ten brains better than yall
Propane make emergency calls, whenever them boys speak
I fold niggas up, make both of the ends meet
You bout to fitness a lyrical fitness
This is what itd sound like if God spoke over beats
I cash in my rap friends
Peep the way I deliver, make you wanna tell your peeps
I consider that they learn from me
This is volcano hot, fuck a third degree
Burn, You gotta be K-D-O-T
Once again its on, I am through with niggas
Twin Glocks, itll shoot niggas
Put you next to a plant, under a root nigga
Hands folded together up in a suit nigga
This what we do nigga, run your mouth, we remote control mute niggas
Matter of fact, I recruit niggas
Bill Thrill straight spook niggas
Sixteens thatll ruin niggas
You mad cause Im gettin figures
Im the bigger picture, you losin dough and mines gettin thicker
I got somethin thatll sting yah I call it the pinch hitter
Gather your mans so they can die with yah
Bill and K-Dot, now yall dealin with the best 
Side by side, yeah we somethin like breasts
Flow game killin, I spit bars of death
Now they yellin could it get any worse
 definition of Hell on Earth
Keep somethin on the side, yeah you know that work
One false move, itll make your whole body jerk
Think before you cross this turf
Youll get turned into ashes, or even laid in the dirt
One for the money, two for my bros
Three for the city, now everybody knows
Watts up, no faking – one shot taken
My life was enticed with mayhem, just praying to God Id make it
City hot as Jamaicans, laying naked with Satan
Just a kid, but what I did would probably leave Jesus shaking
For real – it get real in the field, they kill for pills
And sling packs to dingbats, hoping they’ll cop ‘em some wheels
Niggas start hating, that pistol start clapping
Rat-tat-tat-tat-tatting, no yapping, dapping
Fake fashions? That’ll never happen
We really with this shit – you clowns jiggy rapping
Gee like if Biggie happened to splice with Pac and get it cracking
I take action on acting, I ain’t playing with you
Real whales gave me game, soaked like kiddie pistols
K.Dot gave me respect, the homie like “you crazy blessed”
We finna blow like C4 with no bull in that text
Yes – Mike Jack wouldn’t make it in this thriller
Watts up, watch everybody get familiar
One for the money, two for my bros
Three for the city, now everybody knows
Watts up in this motherfucker
Watts up in this motherfucker
Swallow your pride and then eat a dick, uh
Make the rulers apologize, you ain’t ruling shit, uh
I’m Rick Rubin in ’85 with the beard thick
Thick bitch, type Peruvian, slanted eyes, that’s quench
They tell you that I’m one-up, from sundown to sunup
Son, I son niggas, I probably fucked your mama
With no condom, that’s good pussy
Pussy, tell it to your honor, this drama is Jeffrey Dahmer
It took me through many moons just to set up this new platoon
Get ambushed or kick-pushed with push brooms
Man, look, your man look like Sweet Water
Cornbread that break under pressure if he caught up
Big homie said “I gotta crawl before I walk
And if I ever run my mouth then my legsll get cut off”
See, I’m just a young boss in the bat cave
Back against the wall, and if I fall, Gee Watts bring it back, bang
One for the money, two for my bros
Three for the city, now everybody knows
Watts up in this motherfucker
Watts up in this motherfucker
One for the money, two for my bros
Three for the city, now everybody knows
Watts up in this motherfucker
Watts up in this motherfucker
Yeah, follow me, uh
Picture Kendrick, one of the greatest emcees
Roamin the coast like cellphones on airplane mode
I been at bat for so many years
Now Im out swingin like open marriages
Carry this terrorist flow, say that Im arrogant
Stop playin, thinkin back to rhymin over computer mics
Knew I was tight the moment the speakers had broke
I dipped and dabbled in chronic, but never knew I was dope
You see, my uncles is killers, but never knew I could smoke
A rapper like a .357, do worse enemies
Was God-given, but now Im God, hate to intervene
I sick a lyric on you like K-9s from the police
Let it rip through your briefs, till it bite through your culo
Im Cujo, sumo actor, sumo rapper
Heavy in the game, follow my name, K-Dizzle
A twenty-two-year-old dream, got now
Like a person place or thing hands down like 6:30
You heard me? Im a motherfuckin problem, puto
Give me respect, I hold it down for DJBooth.net
And they tell em K-Dot got next
And they tell em K-Dot got necked
From your baby momma
On my momma, brain like a genius
Im travelin to Venus
Where aliens got pistols round they V-necks
Snub-nose, Kleenex
I suppose I done drove artists to a place
Where the daily deceased sleep at
Competition comin up short like a dwarf
But, of course, Im a short fuse ready to blow
Go head and put your gun down, we can go toe-to-toe
Mano e mano, you aint ready, Im deadly as plec disease
God-given, you trippin, Ive walked the Seven Seas
Moses, cold as they heart, cloned as art
Foamin at the mouth, wildebeest slaughter opponents
Bout business when I kicks this, ridiculous symphony
Tick-tock, boom when you infants give me some room
Central and Rosecrans, Compton dont raise killers
They raise Conans with survival tactics
You love drama? Well, welcome to the land of theatrics
Even a preacher be packin like role managers damage your goods
Cameras roll through the hood, tryin to get that footage
Even newscasters come to your block when you wouldnt
This the city at its best, have a seat, hold your breath
A breath of fresh air, DJBooth.net and Dot
Kendrick Lamar, K-Dot, that is, ha-ha-ha, ha, yeah
Too hot to handle, Too dope to hold
2DopeBoyz we roll deep everybody gather
Your seats, we going to Cloud 9 and we
Coming back in a week, and the weak good
Riddance, only the strong permitted to ride
Or test drive with Kendrick the Jedi, one of a
Kind like great antiques museums buy
Haters I tell em hi, enemies I dont tell em shit
But booya click booya click, click
Ooh, yall done stumbled on a fortune
The rebirth of hip hop since they got abortions
And I rock like Mt. Rushmore, grab your thesaurus
So you can find a synonym of a nigga that been gem
Diamond in the rough
Sheriffs wanna see me cuffed like the links of a button up
Book em down! Fuck is up?
Mind of a Vietnam Vet when a nigga rhyme
A nigga shine, like Im seeing signs in a different light
Im on my grind, see it right? Real starving artist
Finna blow like a Mario Game cartridge, standing on my own two
Me and Dave like Big and Puff before shiny suits
Welcome to the Compton Zoo, lying with a lion on Rosecrans Avenue
A tiger on Central
Arms so soar beating up these instrumentals Sounwave give me
More, after that find a morgue with a mortice, because we..
Too hot to handle, Too dope to hold
2DopeBoyz we roll deep everybody gather
Your seats, we going to Cloud 9 and we
Coming back in a week, and the weak good
Riddance, only the strong permitted to ride
Or test drive with Kendrick the Jedi, one of a
Kind like great antiques museums buy
Haters I tell em hi, enemies I dont tell em shit
But booya click booya click, click
Ooh, and Im back up on my bullshit, shooting to the top with a hollow
Tip full clip
Analogy is like a pit bull on the pulpit, I drool I dont really
Spit, mad dog in this bitch, foaming at the mouth, is you a man or a mouse?
Sipping Mickeys, while you looking like Mickey trapping it out
Thats not a diss, thats really a dope line, and in order to see my vision you
Probably would go blind
Im chilling with a blonde, she dumb as fuck, but she can suck a bowling ball
Through a straw, that make you tell your mom
Im just a little nigga trying to make my city proud, I used to watch Doug and wear
My cousins hand-me-downs
Now Im grown up, unemployed, sipping Henny, pissing throuh a cup, and still get
The job done, 2DopeBoyz I said what up, tell your listeners to have some frost
Bitten gloves cause
Too hot to handle, Too dope to hold
2DopeBoyz we roll deep everybody gather
Your seats, we going to Cloud 9 and we
Coming back in a week, and the weak good
Riddance, only the strong permitted to ride
Or test drive with Kendrick the Jedi, one of a
Kind like great antiques museums buy
Haters I tell em hi, enemies I dont tell em shit
But booya click booya click, click
I love green
When I wake up the sky green
I keep the 40 Glock cocked when Im ridind

You want beef?
Hollow tips leave your eyes blurry
My guys carry, all types of guns

Suck the dick, thats it, then split now its
Back to my gutter tip, 24s on the whip
Montana in the pot, Im the chef on the shift
Niggas yappin at they lip, til my gat at they lip
Then I make they head spin like they drunk off a fifth
I got a lot of chips, I hustle with a lot of pimps

Or a catcher need a mitt, or a sneaker need a grip
A gymnast need a flip, or super head need lifts
Soul-o, yeah Im comin straight for the top

 Huh? Oh shit, can I kick it?
Dragon breathe fire when I spits it
Santa Claus raps got me gifted, lifted
Runnin at the mouth, get it shifted
Blistered, thought it was a dream so I pinched it
Rap got me hooked, so I fished it
Only 6 bars and I sensed it
Rise from defeat, never ran from the beef
Ball hard in the street, Mad Cow with my teeth
Money over bitches, friends over bitches
Hoes over bitches, Benz over switches
Top 5 alive, and you niggas aint listed
Hip hop is dead and you know the boy fixed it
Straight locksmithed it
Open up the doors for the young nigga sellin crack
On the side of stores just to keep the body breathin

And touch the sky for God to stop, debating war
Put the pussy on a pedestal
Put the pussy on a high horse
That pussy to die for
That pussy to die for
Peter Piper picked a pepper so I could pick your brain and put your heart together

Hey, hey
You know once upon a time, not long ago
There was a caterpillar that lived life slow
And a couple inches he stood
And he said to the butterfly, Whats good?
And the butterfly told him one day he gon make him rich
And then they said something else
I dont remember what they said
But I think it was something like the lines of:
Wesleys Theory:
When I get signed, homie, Imma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary thing for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat old monkey
Imma buy a brand new Caddy on fours
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everything, platinum on wedding ring
Married to the game and a bad thing chose
When I get signed, homie, Ima buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass them all out on the block, whats good?
Imma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the Pres with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check hold on
We shouldve never gave
We shouldve never gave brothers
Money go back home, money go back home
We shouldve never gave
We shouldve never gave brothers, money go back home, money go back home
Momma:
This feeling is unmatched
This feeling is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap
We dont share the same synonym, fall back
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radios nemesis made me wack
My innocence limited the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribbling scratching diligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
 Oh, whats going on?
 I think something on my mind, too
 I think its about that time
 Hit me!
King Kunta:
I got a bone to pick, uh
I dont want you monkey-mouth... sitting in my throne again
Im mad , but I aint stressing, noo
True friends, one question
Tell me, where you when I was walking?
Now I run the game, whole world talking, King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Tell me where you when I was walking?
Now I run the game, whole world talking, King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams 
The yam is the power that be, be, be, be, be
You can smell it when Im walking down the street
I can dig rappin, wait!
But a rapper with a ghost writer, tell me what happened to you?
No, I swore I wouldnt tell
But most of yall sharing bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell 
Somethings in the water 
And if I gotta brown nose for some gold
Then Id rather be a bum than a dumb, dumb baller
Tell me, where were you when I was walking?
Now I run the game got the whole world talking, King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Tell me where were you when I was walking?
Now I run the game, whole world talking, King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams... 
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor, R.I.P.
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires, hol up
24/7, 365 days times two, I was contemplating getting on stage
Go back to the hood, see my enemy and say
Tell me, where were you when I was walkin?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin, King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Tell me where were you when I was walkin?
Now I run the game, whole world talkin, King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams... 
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
Body suicidal, they aint even need my help
This is elementary, Ill probably go to jail
Shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Flag in my city, everybodys screaming Compton!
Probably run for Mayor when Im done, to be honest
Put that on my Mama and my baby boo, too
u:
Aahh, aahh, aahh!
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you aint it, feel like you dont feel
Confidence in yourself, breaking on marble floors
Watching anonymous strangers, telling me that Im yours
But you aint it, Im convinced your tolerance nothing special
What can I blame you for, I can name several
Situations, Ill start with your little sister baking
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
What was your influence, where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
I tell you, you damn failure — you aint no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you — I dont need you!
The world dont need you, dont let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, buck your pride too, thats for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
I hate you, I hope you embrace it
I swear
Loving you is complicated, loving you is -mplicated
Loving you is compli-, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you, not loving you, one hundred proof
Youre afraid of me
Yes I
When you look in my eyes
Tell me theres more inside
Tell me youre feeling high
Tell me youre here tonight
Tell me you hear my pain
Hear my soul, how you feeling?
Now you know
If you see it, if you would, God
Now get the gold, yeah!
Wooh!
Lets lets talk talk bout bout love
Lets lets talk talk bout bout trust
Lets lets talk talk bout bout you
Lets lets talk talk bout bout us
Lets talk about our love
And when its said and done
Gimme some of you you 
Baby got a nigga feeling like kid again
Make the homie wanna go and have a kid and then
Marry on an island probably on a private boat
Total silence while we gliding on Hawaiis coast
Body of a goddess
Brains of a Harvard student
Her intellect can intercept the brightest star moving
Hear the horns playing?
They playing for that girl
I aint playing I plan to go around the world
Might settle down
Like fuck bitches
Call the homies up

They playing for that women
She think a nigga on

How it feel to be with somebody that you define
As the perfect human that shaped under his design
God almighty
Golly you probably over-shadow sunshine

For them hoes thats playing catch up inside the city
Or catching feelings when they hearing that you fucking with me
Or Im fucking with you, that vise versa

In the beginning it always good
Until..
It makes no difference in this life
Up and ups just fine
On the up and up this life
Til were down on our luck
It makes no difference in this life
Up and ups just fine 
On the up and up this life
Til the lift gets stuck 
Lifting up, lifting up

They wanna see your hands, tell you hold up your arms 
Dont do it, dont dont do it
Dont do it, dont dont do it
Dont do it, dont dont do it
We were going home
Waiting for the kids
School bus to arrive
Oh, but you know, theyre gonna do it anyway
Reaching for your keys
Wait, is that your phone?
Got a TBI
Wait, is that police?
Get out for what?

Wife behind the trees
Tryna to tell you dont
Theyre about to fire

They wanna see your hands, tell you hold up you arms
Dont do it, dont dont do it
Dont do it, dont dont do it

Whoa Ferguson, oh Baltimore
Raleigh, North Carolina
But you know, theyre gonna do it anyway
Wisconsin, Tulsa, Oklahoma
Cleveland, Ohio
Montgomery, Baton Rouge, Cincinnati car
Dayton, Ohio
But you know, theyre gonna do it anyway
New York, New Jersey, Phoenix, Minnesota
South Carolina
They gonna do it anyway
They are gonna do it anyway
They are gonna do it anyway
They are gonna do it anyway
They are gonna do it anyway
You better duck, run fast from the mania
Dont stare, dont laugh at the media
Brake free, press gas when it enter ya
Dont let it go bad when he ante up
Highway, get out the way
Black man do your great escape
Pac-man wanna prosecute you
Raise your hand up, and theyll shoot ya
Face off, face off Adolf Hitler
Grandkids slayed off
Niggas, same rules, same chalk
Different decade, same law
Keep focus, you wanna get caught with your eyes open
You wanna stay clear of the prognosis
Pride provoked him, watch demotion
Watch em close enough
Dont let the holster break or roast ya
Rollercoaster ride that bitch
Soon or later sides gon switch
You know Johnny got that itch
How many more of us gotta see the coroner?
Slain by the same badge, stop, wait, brake, fast!
Dont do it, dont dont do it
Dont do it, dont dont do it
Dont do it, dont dont do it
Dont do it, dont dont do it
Life is full of up and downs
Twists and turns
But somehow we keep on steppin
These walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? I’m just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated, every nook and cranny
I mean its still amazing before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around demolition might crush
If these walls could talk 
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it
These walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I rather miss them
I rather call, I rather diss them
I rather fall on you, put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition go crush
If these walls could talk 
I can feel your reign when it cries , gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk 
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it
And reality is
Sometimes through these ups and downs
You gotta know when to lead or to follow
Keep steppin
Chi-town
If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Build accessories and stash them on the are
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening no calling CO
No calling your homie to save you
Homies to say youre reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me
Retaliation is strong, you even dream bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hour of the morning
About her baby daddy thats currently serving life
How she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she messing with famous rapper
Walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
Verse 1 
They found me under the sea, with three dollars and sixty cents
So why would it make any sense for me to not make any since
The curly head, black lipped kid
That works at Magic Disk, be on some shit
I take a stand then make you sit
You take a stand, and then you snitch
What part of the game is that huh?
Pardon my frame of mind, but if you get out of line, itll be a disaster
I take trips and pass out the most
Monumental rapper, dont ever go toe to toe
With those whos over dosing, on the antidote
Effortless I wreck this shit
Ab-Soul-loutly definite
Bet your deficite, that you aint testing it
Im excellence on ecstasy
If you can fathom such a combo, off the Humboldt
Smellin like Im lightin a pine cone
Feeling like my mind got caught in a cyclone
I should put a spell on you niggas, like a typo
TaeBeast, TDE, El Campo
Carson, K-I-N-G, Del amo
Verse 2 
Uh, sittin in my homeboys apartment
In them dirty halls, burner in my dirty draws.... watch it!
For the boys that want it all, just got into altercation at the mall
But niggas know my protocol, ready for my homicide
Put me in a position, to have my finger itchin
Dont jump up in the game if you aint ready for the kitchen
Cause best believe the stove hot, cooking up beef up in the box till my time stop
Barb wires and pig cops
Every door get into locks, phone aint got no dial tone
Look up and the clouds gone, hungry and my childs gone
Solitary mind state, push ups help me stay straight
Noodles help maintain, reading helps me isolate
Troubles help me concentrate, enemies evacuate
Let me hyperventilate
Hoping that my girlll still be on it and the mother fuckers call me in the mornin
Verse 3 
Fuck that shit, Imma blow it up
Fuck that shit, Imma load it up
Dump that clip, like a movie script
Whether blood or crip, I dont give a fuck
Imma live it up, my time is now
Time and time again, I got that sound
Thatll drown, Titanic, in Atlantics ocean
Im hoping, that they both go down
Nigga please, nigga hand your bitch your keys
So she can push your humvee, to my place we can smoke your weed
Pray to god that Im not god, MC bumped in your ipod
Simply I am the CyHi of Centennial High dont give me no tie
I ready made my business mine, dec-i-mals are definite
Deficate on music mates, and bet, I do it delicate-ly
Ignore your celiba-cy and then tell you fuck you
Aye what the fuck you want, my fucking dick, you fucking cunt
Get off my n-u-t, s, he yes, got that unorthodox flow
Niggas is trapped, they dont hold no wraps but they calling 5-0
Smash in a El Dorado, whip it straight, till the fender break
In the middle of the street, where the criminals be
While I blaze this heat from the Tae Beast.... tape
Kendrick Lamar
Ayo, K-Dot? You up on that new Snoop Dogg? That nigga shit bae! I aint fuckin with none of these new niggas, but that nigga, Snoop Dogg? That nigga back!

Didnt think I would last, Im adrift on a draft
While Im flippin my craft, hold a gift to the gab
Cre-i-zippin my rag see, hop on the grass
Peep-pop on these suckers tryna avoid the clash
But if I must I must, let me raise my glass
Tryna move on off and put you on up - some fresh game
Or how to maintain, sustain and gangbang
You never change, you stay the same

Lada-di-di-di-da-da!
Horse and a carriage
Sports in a marriage, all in a days work

Longevity, heavenly blowing kush heavily
Rearrange my melody, no more felonies
Shout-out to my mama Beverly, and my grandmother the elderly should be upheld to the utmost
Dorothy Tate, half the reason why Im great
Mississippi the state
Let me shake back, right back to the beat
And keep supplying yall with more heat for the street

Yessir
Livin in my own world, I could never die
Ambition of a hundred kings livin in the sky
Nothin can stop me, no nothin can stop me
My destiny tellin me that God got me
Grace in my own greatness and I made this
Pandemonium and victory, I can taste it
Set me free, I wanna be set free
I wanna be remembered in my own legacy
We fight, we cry, we live, we die as kings
We multiply with gold, our hearts will bleed
You recognize this more than just my dream
Once you realize, youll know what lies beneath
Know what lies beneath, know what lies beneath
Close your eyes and youll realize you know what lies beneath
Nothin can stop me, no nothin can stop me
My destiny tellin me that God got me
Came from darkness, I made it with sharpness
Back when I said that I tried my hardest
I will not lose, I paid my dues
I failed several times, I tied my shoes
For someone start with my nigga Al Mack
The first real nigga I lost
Even though he used to gang bang
Well never be able to see his chain swang
But thats that Jesus piece lost
Cause he would have rocked it well
But instead he rocked that hair full of braids braided by his girl Leesi
With the semi on, nigga had game kinda cold
Never killed a soul, so he never had a problem
With thinking hisself was gettin old
Livin life like it never would happen
Shit, niggas dyin like life really goin full circle
Thought we was gon live to see it all
Til that day that he died on a head-on collision with a motorcycle
Its true, cool niggas die too
Yeah nigga, Its true, cool niggas die too
It could happen to me, it could happen to you
But yeah Its true
California economics, killer assignments
School test scores drop, murder rates climbin
Scarface where you watch, try to reenact
And launched over the balcony, buck shots in our backs
Every day casualties got me losin my sanity
Cannons be within arm reach, Im all panicky
Last week I had a run in with my enemys friend
Shit, finna be dead man quick
Grab the pistola, hollup, complimentary of the cig
But then the boys rolled up, we both admit
Close call, the ghetto is like a quick game of tennis ball
Youre probably well preserved until you get served
Through the knowledge I get a few dollars, you gettin demolished
If you cruise through Compton wearin red or blue
See colors in these niggas eyes
Is like a favorite color bein told by the blind, dont really matter
I met Jamico when I went to high-school
They stayed around the corner bur shit, I never knew
Me and Kisel Ken in the basement playing drums, making music
While she fussin yellin down the stairs, Im on the phone you losers
I remember late for school every morning thirsty for that Mickey Ds
Not knowin the death of her mother matured her very quickly
So we gon fast forward school graduated, went to college got married
They had a pretty little girl but the world couldnt make her tardy
Died from a seizure at her daughters birthday party
Uhn, Blue chucks, swing Glocks, they both in my pants
Im a gangsta I can do no wrong
Fuck with the lights on, and say I love you baby
Cause tomorrow may not make it to me
I got a kilo and a seven series, when a crown went crack, nigga
I bet the gun sale plat, oh
ATF be on that sucker shit
They hate a black nigga with getting moneys involved
Got an ounce in my draws
I just wanna live forever my nigga
Took the blue pill, crack the axillae
If Q said it then you know that shit real
Pistol grip up, on my lap all times
I used to drive a Honda, with the dimes inside
Now drive by is by the marks that killed Bebes kids
So the gun is who my role model is, The illest Crip in a Benz
Look, Im never half of my steppin, Im never not with my weapon
So youll get got in a second like
Gotta understand my disposition, see I was raised a little different
Disenchanted former county check recipient
Reminiscin of a Mexican immigrant
Cept the borders my existence, stripped away my innocence
Constantly conflicted over color restrictions
You outta your district, you end up on a milk carton missin
Thats average every day California livin
Race riots in the yard spill outside of the prison
Besides the killings, West Coast cap peelin
This California lifestyle was so appealin
Imagine the women, exotic cars, custom driven
You on your Hollywood thing, what a beautiful feelin, aint it?
Such a perfect picture painted
Yet its tainted by the unfortunate and less famous
I aint complainin, its home
Just somethin to ride to when youre off in the zone
This a little somethin you can ride and smoke to
Stay on point, niggas will ride and smoke you
This a little somethin you can ride and smoke to
Stay on point, niggas will ride and smoke you
Wanna be involved with the underworld dealers
East Coast bodyers, West Coast cap peelers
Wanna be involved with the underworld dealers
East Coast bodyers, West Coast cap peelers
Change is coming, change is here
Holla if you hear me
In the memory of 2Pac sincerely
Been a G, since standing four feet on the monkey bars
Steal a niggas box like it was ours
Cars roll up, Nah we dont fold up
We just hold up our guns like championship cigars
Mama hold the porch sipping OE out of a straw
I remember it all, them early Compton days
Shit, I put my all in them high school hallways
Montgomery never saw the dime bags
Finshed my work, finished a sale right before class was over
Now whats over Im old enough to put the world on my shoulders without a massage
Never came in the truck no more, we back seat
Times is rough, the only time your pledge your allegiance
If youre shot in the heart bleeding
Ouch
Its gutter when the sun come up
When the sun go down
Nothing but tears, no onions
Under the ungodly functions, 187s and robbery will come
Dont go looking for it
Dont look like you hard
Youre better off looking foreign, Im warnin ya
Before that warm temperature warmin up
Your blood temperature, that corner filled with coroners
The neighbors is listeners
Im the future of the new west for you visitors
Never mind them other niggas
Im talkin in particular
Just cause you got the flu dont mean youre sick enough
Im igloo cold with it
If California snows then I did it
The 21st of June Ill make a blizzard
The OG aim they guns at the moon
Bullets break through the atmosphere
Fear no man but God, the God of rap is here
And I can see you scared 
Real gangsters either dead or in jail
And you dont look like a zombie and I dont see no cells
I sink niggas blackships, he wont sail
And his album really aint shit, he wont sell
And I had that mind state since twelve
No skates on my feet just running the turf for life like football cleats
5 hours asleep, nigga you do the math
Thats 19 hours lost, I got insomnia bad
But, I cant complain or happen to think it too much, came passion Albert Einstien gained
Had to hold my stomach for hunger pains over looking ?
This business got too many villians
Superman is back
The cape aint red, its black
Thats a trench coat
And the note for your information if we was dead this recarnation
Watch your heads
I rather die on my mother fucking feet fore a nigga live on his knees
Twin Glocks in my palm back against the wall Im ready for war
My enemies die slow when I ride screaming THUG LIFE pistol in the sky
Remember me as a real nigga when I go
The Hennessy got me riding dirty with my crew, nigga M-O-B
Pussy ass niggas better duck they tails
Niggas can hide when my squad bail nigga we ballin
Alizé and weed keept on callin gotta get some more
Intoxicated got almost had me falling lemme hit the floor
World Wide MOB figures I bet you all of my niggas ready to die nigga
Can you feel me? World Wide MOB Figure
Dont even wear yo strap if you aint ready to die nigga
My attitude like fuck it middle finger towards the public
Bringing buckets to all my adversaries and I love it
My momma stress every night telling me to slow down
I said Momma Im in too deep aint no turning back now
Cause the niggas from the other side they want me dead
Catch me slipping roll up on me put a hole in my head
And the chronic just to got me even more paranoid
Looking out the window if they coming Im ready for em
Just remember 2Pacalypse never ran from em
Ran to em eyes open with both guns dumpn
And till then tell them mother fuckers to strap up
Guns blazing when they act up
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
So I move way different than I used to
Eyes in back of my head everything bulletproof
Walking out the house cautious
Circle round the block twice before my car park it
My allies despise my success so they got me watching my every step
No exaggeration I know I can feel the reapers breath
Hovering over me like a helicopter or a 747 on autopilot
All of my problems dissolve once I take control of my own destiny
Hop on my murder chart overcome the odds
This goes out to all my dogs
Just holler if you hear me like a charger made by dodge made by dodge
Just ask Pac what its like to be ready every night
AK-47 by the window aiming at car lights
For Makaveli the Mac is ready to explode
On any mother fucker who curse his soul
Death around the corner
I saw him near last week
In my Oldsmobile some niggas try to blast me
So I cocked back the 4-5 no lie
Let my trigger finger fly like Nigga Nigga die
Close call player haters wanna see me fall
I shows no mercy you better be ready for war
Fuck the law should I ride on my own two
No crew just see what this Mac-11 gon do
Plenty bodies gon be dropping soon as I come through
Hop out let it rip head slugs go threw
BOW-BOW-BOW-BOW sound of my melody
Murder murder kill kill what them voices be telling me
Ever since a baby a nigga was living crazy
Age 13 playing with heaters ready for beef like
You want it you can get it anyway that you want it
Hit yah block, parents get smoked fast like marijuana
I trust no one everyday Im watching my back
Its a well known fact that I see death around the corner

Never seen a stop sign or a stop light
I wanna see what livin on the top like
You wanna see what livin on the top like
Then shadow me and take me on a joy-ride
Look both ways wherever there I go
In case I run into you, I drive slow
I know your sex-drive go all day
Then we can roll till tomorrow
Lights out for the insecure, self-centered
I know your heart wont be the same when I
Dive in head first, I dont mind if I drown

Diggy Doc, this one is for you
I remember growing up
Just a Dogg Pound pup bumping G Thang
Its that gin and juice in my cup
And all I knew was N.W.A
Eazy, Yella and Ren, Ice Cube and Dre
Big Snoop, Warren G, Nate Dogg and raised
Kurupt, Daz and RBX, the original gang
Bad ass super fly, I can go on for days
D.P.G.C., thats the way I was raised
And motherfucking 2Pac was my shit
Especially when he was rocking on the Doc shit
Killa Cali where it all started
Legacy, me, Im just happy to be a part of it
This west shit

All the shit you did for hip hop and gangsta rap
For that 
Without further adieu
Diggy Doc, this one is for you
I remember when it all started
On Alondra in that small apartment
Burgundy carpet and SEGA cartridges
Pop a flick and blunt ashes all on the garments
Momma of off wine cooler, Magic Johnson played Jordan
I was only four, but it was like I heard it before
A house party cracking of the music the Doctor recorded
And according to my awareness I was more than coherent
A cold listener, mocking that shit like a parrot
My cousins kicking up dust cripping
The flag, they wear it around their hand like a mitton
Aiming use it for leverage
Shitting on Compton sheriffs like fuck the police
Woofers and gold rollies
Every swap meet should know me
Cause I copped every record that dropped
Dropped the dub just to hear Doc drop
A jewel for the sake of hip hop
Who ever have thought the moment I see you bullets for Cali love
Fifteen years later you be saving my life, what
Reminiscing on when we used to smoke chronic
Now we puffing the kush and Im like
For giving the West Coast CPR
Now here we are, we like to

Diggy Doc, this one is for you
Classic, Young Gotti
Gangsta, gangsta

Son, I son niggas I probably fucked up your mama
No condom, its good pussy
Pussy, tell it to your honor that this trauma is Jeffrey Dahmer
Took me too many moons set up this new platoon
Get ambushed or kicked, pushed with push broom
Man look, your man, look like sweet water
Corn bread to break under pressure if hes caught up
Big homie said I gotta crawl before I walk
And if I ran my mouth then my legs would get cut off
Im just a young boss with a bat cave
Back against the wall closer my back came back with them back pains, whoa
Tell em put my name on the blimp
Ball like Im Derrick Rose you should know my gym
You playas not allowed Im sparking your game towels
And spikn your Gatorade with gasoline Im foul
Im in the crowd like Artest and them
I move the crowd like Artest and them
Punchlines mean I really go punch civilians
Crunch time mean I take it to the hole
Not this basket but rather the good pussy that Im in
I assassin you niggas I make you wait shake in
Blank tapes in your deck, niggas still break their neck
They hear it you need plans with the label just to spin
I need to clear it with the bank just to win
Club accounts go 15 racks when you wet like that shit
Its gotta be a sin. Hm. so Lord forgive me Im a sinner
Hm. These hoes squeeze me cause Im a winner
Back when we ate canned food for dinner, I coat food and the..tools make my agenda
I show fools Im nasty like tofu I wish a
Motherfucker would get your whole career injured
This assault what a deadly weapon
Guilt your favourite rapper, favourite rapper last record

Thats some of you niggas bless with the gift to carry the presence
A big in Pac and pop with..and with investments
15 minutes come up with 60 seconds
Last month Ive been six hours inside of session
Came up with shit writers block niggas up in this stressing
Like who the fuck cares? who the fuck cares? Even if you get drunk up
Still be a millionaire
You could play a Santa Claus and make sure youre the whole dear
Every verse I put that bitch in the hearse, while boy stear

Monkey see what monkey do, you monkeys never make no tips
Climbup the tree shit on you

Hastle and breaking your picket fence

Clappin if you resist to cooperate, go home and see their daughters go..

We can taste it from planet pluto
Dog Gonnit you panic just like a poodle rip out your culo then kudos

I’m a Nestor Ave tibby rock thrower
Nightlife liver, still waiting to throw up
25 cents, Now & Later, and a soda
Snotty-nosed kids slap boxing on the corner
Yeah, that’s me right there
Sandy little Jordans and the swoosh in his hair
In the overall shorts, I ain’t have a care in the world
Contact, ‘cause my call right there
I thought I was Pac when ‘Hit ‘Em Up’ came out
Got in trouble for the music, I was playin’ it loud
Read the credits to all the CDs in the house
With the bottle I was rockin’ the crowd
I was eight when I wrote my first rap line down
Shit, I remember, I was right on the couch
Are you feeling me? Back in third grade I was killing it
If y’all don’t get the metaphor, it’s all elementary
Summertime fun, mack daddy at the pool
Wintertime fun, selling candy at the school
Ready for the action, if it happened, I was cool
I ain’t see ‘em, if you do, tell my daddy I’m a fool, Kendrick
Kendrick Lamar, plain old Kendrick the Average Joe
But not the average flow, just willing to make it, ock
That boy’s bacon, he got relations with Satan, Pops
This type of greatness is well-awaiting the fatal shots
Now what you know about them Westside streets?
We was five like deep, rapping the best of Mobb Deep
Rapping my best in my sleep, that’s if I ever slept
Countin’ bars while you countin’ sheep, you lookin’ at the best
God-given, I’m been spitting since Pokémon cards and yo-yos
Sauconies Girbaud jeans, when Wayne made “bling-bling” I was hip-hopping
Makin’ ‘em hop, have a pogo
Let’s get this cream, cold stones
I’m fallin’ off, hold on
When peeling off, BMX bikes
Ducking shots that was barking real DMX-like
A pizza and a cold Sprite
Peace to the world
I close my door and make love to the beat
Then fuck your girl
That was K.Dot then
Top-tier, I’m here, they call me King Hope
With a mean flow dancing for the team, ock
Street hop from the bottom, we on the street’s top
It’s all scenic, believe it, you’ll get your bean popped
I give you my album in replacement of Detox
I drop shit with ease to let y’all eavesdrop
On my style, eyes of an owl as they watch
Throw in that towel or get thrown in a ditch
Or get thrown on the pit, I was thrown on stages
Tab, Centennial, Westchester lacing
My flow ’96, your flow ‘06
Your flow “eh, cool…”, my flow “oh shit!”
You flow don’t exist, we co-exist with the UFOs
Goddamnit, stranded on planets that you don’t know
The aliens panic, pack they bags, they hit the road
The truth, the phone booth, the greatness take its toll
Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with the headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely had patience
And youre relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
Went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came, checks didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I could shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow
But why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
They say I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down
My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
Intuition got a black woman wishin
She sayin this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, hoping you could make it
Women dont prosper chasing education
But youre talented, and cant handle it
And your homegirls cant be your manager
365 times four, plus more
Cant get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But aint no money like fast money
Even today Im considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them
But why Im so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
They say I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down to the top
I love god, I love speed, I love drank, I love me
I love oceans in the deep
I love women, I love me
I love God
But I’m scared of god speed
Sometimes
Wrote this song looking at a broke home maybe
You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and baby
Somebody say Kendrick American they sho’ is crazy
And I said “why?”
Then he looked me in the eye
He said homie you messed up
You breaking my good luck
You wishing for miracles
Living through shit, you’re crying hysterical
Settle for everything, complain about everything
Say your soul crack, my world amphetamines
You projects ain’t it, I live in the hood
You living to keep warm
I’m living to pay rent
I paid my way through
Praying to Allah
You played your way through dealing with Wi-Fi
Bull shit yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing go for the ones you came with
We all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope
These days ain’t no compromise
Your pain ain’t mine half the time
A brand new excuse ain’t nothing to me
See I made my moves, with shackled feet
Cape Town, Cape Town, Cape Town, Cape Town
Cape Town, Cape Town, Cape Town
Corn row Kenny
I wanna get the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrr
I wanna get the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrr, skrr
Corn row Kenny
So many plays on me I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I react
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure play with him, you get killed
Play with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
I did a lot of dumb things in my past
Love will give me hope and I won’t relapse
Dave just bought a new nine eleven
Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Rashad got his son dripping in gold
Me? I’m ‘bout to let my hair down on hoes
Ali bout to let his hair down on hoes
Top billing that’s a million a show
Might blow the Whole Remy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave got a Grammy this year
Mack wop, but he do what he want
Level two, level two
No I’m not done
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
I could put a rapper on life support
Guarantee something that none of you want
Then hold me down and they yell something like
Rent is like twenty five hundred a month
What if I empty my bank out and skrrrt?
What if I empty my bank out and skrrt?
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t got, you ain’t got
You ain’t got, you ain’t got
Tell me that, tell me that
That, I am the One
You ain’t got, you ain’t got
You ain’t got
You ain’t got tell me that, what I’m the one
Yes, I’m the one
They leave the city behind us
Straight out of Compton
You need a compass to find us
Waters that blue when people called me your highness
Prince of Zamunda, you get in tune with the lions
Away from the rumors and those who assume what I am
Parked onto Hollywood to Hawaiian
Bitches I’m in the reach of 90 degree climate
It’s me, beautiful sounds at CCYN’s
Cheer CLK slash G Wagon driving
I’m a L-A-M-B-O hoppin out, cool on auto pilot
Smooth ass babies bottoms with Johnson baby powder
Hey coward, suck a big dick with aids on the tip
No homo, yall just make me sick
I’m ready for war
I got my riffle, my sword
Blueprint mapped out, this is what’s it all about
But for now cop a sweet out in Singapore
Piña colada with umbrella straws I’m telling y’all
This is Big K nigga
Big clip in broad day nigga
Big K, wave it your way nigga
Nigga I’m gone
Nigga I’m ghost
Bout to touchdown on a whole another coast
Jumping off planes
Hoppi on boats
Gon throw it up
Then nigga let’s toast
Nigga I’m gone
Nigga I’m ghost
Bout to touchdown on a whole another coast
Jumping off planes
Hoppin on boats
Even when I’m gone, know my heart’s still close
Out the hood
Now Im walkin through that white sand
With some Latin women who any watching them belly dance
I got a belly ache, I’m eating too fast
I can’t slow down, they force feeding me the cash
I got a big appetite so I chow down
Pocket full of hundreds, fuck it I’m a boss now
I make boss moves
Bitch I’m overseas
Fucking on four bitches, blowing foreign trees
Amsterdam, maybe Oslo, Norway
I’d do me, I give a damn what a whore say
True P pinstripes like Jorge
Yankees fitted on blinds through the doorway
Ha, yeah I’m back on that gully shit
Number one hustler to get money wit
N. Jersey Devil, yeah you heard me
But you giving out the trust, I gained it early
Exit out this fake shit, no thrills
Get back to reality, travelling through the hills
Bitch I’m out of here
Deuces, peace
Pendejo, carajo, adiós, capeesh
Nigga I’m gone
Nigga I’m ghost
Bout to touchdown on a whole another coast
Jumping off planes
Hoppi on boats
Gon throw it up
Then nigga let’s toast
Nigga I’m gone
Nigga I’m ghost
Bout to touchdown on a whole another coast
Jumping off planes
Hoppin on boats
Even when I’m gone, know my heart’s still close
Was a good student, got all As
So the music that Im producing is sort of like high grade
You can get so high that
You wont need a pilot
Everytime you listen youre gaining frequent flyer mileage
Politic on project knowledge with street scholars
In need of fatter wallets so they seek dollars
Holla, at the God, inhale, exhale
Then hail the king draped in Pharaohs bling
Or something like it
Some will like it, others wont
But understand the flow is as smooth as a summer night is
Off the top when I write this
And the plan is to get a girl with the same eyes
As the goddess Isis
Looking for my Nefertiti in the city
Where we substituted hieroglyphics for graffiti
Dont get smacked silly, with ill battle raps
Under pressure niggas twist like sprite bottle caps
Tell Semtex to gather all his effects
Cause this here might get a few bombs from Flex
A few niggas vexed when we on the set
So a few niggas gotta get palms and necks
Cracked, snapple pop, pay attention ahk
Me and Mickey bout to make this Black apple pop
Like Snapple tops
From BK to the City of Angels
City where niggas throw up their hands in angles
To represent their tribes
And other colors, niggas love us
Kiss the mothers, raise the brothers Ill teach you something
You niggas got the game all wrong
You rapping for niggas in all yall songs
I got songs like Treat Her Right unh
Ladies know when I perform, I be the right form
Any blog, website, Tumblr or forum
Youre drug trafficking when you post up these poems
Love it or you dont
But yo my lyrics you will quote
You wanna see whats up, get a beat thats tough
Ill eat it up for sure
If you live than Im liver, if you hot than Im lava
Burning up, Im the agua, shut you down when I rise up
Fucking ducking when I come in bucking with something rugged
Niggas can hate it, but as long as the ladies they love it
Check out the ratio at all our shows
Im the God, I get all the...queens
Kendrick Lamar the modern day Malcolm
Humble and modest but these margins can move a mountain
I moshpit on the beat and leave the mark of a thousand ,Marksmen
Clearing the street and killing rappers with talent, preach
Yes I said talent, Kendrick aint scared of yall, can’t even spell competitor
Lord is my witness
I remember asking artists in streets how they did it
The only features I got is was this handsome face I was getting
How ironic, playing Sonic was the shit like a colonic
Now we vomit over these beats while critics pay homage
This is too street like my 23 summers in Compton
I go so deep, like my dick in your bitch hope the condom never do leak
2 seats, one car, all you hear yes daddy and snapped bras
High salary blow jobs, low calorie rap bars not me
My sweet 16 will probably need a school ID
And usually I be, the dominant victor
You know what time it is nigga
Affirmative Action, you fact or you fiction?
I’m a slain cracker from being insane
Pop a vein when I write this shit
I’m think on the shit, Im vain and I think you’re a bitch
A female poodle under some homos voodoo, sucking the industrys dick
We catching bodies, shooting dice in the hotel lobby, fuck your security
And thats at the Ritz-Carlton
My impuritys probably your best asset
I spit acid, hit your block and crumble your address
Leaving them stagnant
This is torture when I scorch you, or escort you
Out the building where ex-convicts with all sorts of
Portable handshanks, your man can’t stick to the script with handpaint
Popping your lip then popping the clip then popping your van, wait
We want the peace, but keep a piece
Said I was Malcolm to your belief whats up
Its Mickey
From the depths of the seas
Back to the rap
Mick Factz motherfucker
From the, the, the Black Apple
Where the nightmares reign supreme
Stay ahead never beg cause I aim to please
Brain disease, sick spit flame degrees
Thatll make Satan leave til his veins will freeze
Museum Mick, international women with high class
Will do E and look at you like Im gassed
Oxymoron, big dog evict frauds
Slick boss that shop, tags get ripped off
I dont lie about what I cop like Rick Ross
Come to broads I dish off like Chris Paul
Quickdraw McGraw shoot and spit raw
Im too hot cause I was born with a pitchfork
This kid hard, when Im pissed off you lift off
These lip gloss ass rappers are so chick soft
Look lil mama, we aint blood so Crip-walk
We aint fam, you aint my man so skip off
You get your Rafer on, I get my paper on
Im sonning cats, Im getting my Darth Vader on
Check the program
Im killing rappers
Barbarian, Im Conan
You hear the flow man
The best I know with my chest out bro
The Achievement is coming, thats not an Xbox goal
Lyrics from Snippet
Too many opinions in the glasshouse
This world full of ego, let me cash out
Jump in that—, jump in that bitch 
Jump in that— , jump in that bitch 
Jump in that— , jump in that—
Jump in that bitch 
Jump in that bitch, run in that bitch
Jump in that-jump in that bitch
Two trench coats in the bag
Baby Keem, king of rap
And I think he just came back
How the fuck did I go back?
Get your case off my back
That my son, wait, relax
Beat my son, go to your room
Stop sneak-dissin, that aint bool
Play both sides, huh
She love all my guys, huh
And I never came down from the last time
But that dont mean nothing, niggas still climbing
Bitches popping bottles and they sipping pink diamonds
I took a break from the game and I seen these niggas clowning
The blogs wouldnt be the same if you took Spitta out it
Props to the ones who instrumentally getting me popping
Balling without first learning the fundamentals, forget about it
Tryna 360 up the middle, you aint even learn to dribble
Twiddling my thumbs smoking lime
Watching hamster ass rappers running wheels going nowhere with their rhymes
Stuck, Glenn Robinson big dog bus, socks up, top down, killing squares, riding around
Coolest nigga in yo city, even when Im not in town
Smoking like I signed for 50 million and Im underground
Yeah, uh
Smoking like I signed for 50 million still underground
And who we are, flow away above all, see
If I didnt rap I still look like a star, just admit, you know
You can spot me from afar, no big diamond chain that was so old for
Just a mention going up, its nothing that I fire
Put the ladies sleeping over, slumber parties every night
Get your flights from … sending me all over
Bring me to the club, cause all the bitches like
What other rapper you know can call from Dakota, anger ...and call from a favor
And Brooklyn and Queens cause they got Im a king
Avoiding tattoos, ...take the music …
My kicks so is fresh no scuffs from the ground, this niggas too fly, cant get scuffs from the clouds
This aint even my city but shit might as well, thats why me and spitta sold out ATL
Jet setter, Ive been iller, causing vendettas with all of you Ben Stillers
These little fuckers hate my endeavors, time for men sweaters under chinchillas
Trend setter, kick killer my feet wear caskets
Fresh to death and rare glasses, the bomb bottles, rose petals and Ford models
Who all follow my Twitter and still sword swallow
DM me, got him in the frenzy, its all about the benjies
Im feeling like the kembe, block haters stop player Im so clean
My pockets love the earth baby they go green
Sitting back in that cold thing, wanna rock the mic but she dont sing
Messing with the flow king, kiss the gold ring, pucker up buttercup, or knuckle up to these punch lines that uppercut
Chillin in my teepee, no indian but he be
The realest shit I must admit Im baskin in my feces
My style is harder, yours is watered down they call it fiji
The bible or my CD, both of them were said to be the
Formula to live your life, or coping with the ills
No time to play kid, I think you needs to chill
House party with killers, pray for Italy villas
Where accents think its Buffy and chandeliers hang from ceilings
Im dreaming, Im scheming to be major
Compose art like a Mozart, the sequel to Amadeus, today is
The day I see the sun, ignoring all the rain
The fat lady has sung, octaves as high as planes
Paper bout the forest tree, acres of that THC
I dont smoke but homies do, find the cloud and have a seat
And I wonder how ... live to see 80
I just wanna see Mercedes give me head in Mercedes
My turbulence put a burden on young herds
And once its cracking its a chain reaction
Minus Young Berg
Killing with no excellence
X-amount with no excellence
To X em out with these words
Panoramic views be tumbling out my mind
No panoramic views, bullets tumbling out no nines
Big AKs like Alicia Keys abbreviated
And nowadays, niggas stand behind em like Clive Davis
Clyde Drexler, before the hook I dribble niggas
On the stretcher. A understatement to say
That K Lamar was under pressure
Dont press your luck when you pressed for time
Cause when the press get this verse
Theyre sure to press rewind
A presidents prayer, cant say whats in my cul de sac
Codeine, crack and codiac
Enough violence to keep the Devil smiling while we
Wyling on the corners with the ? rats
Niggas build a trap house, hope that Gotti
Dont run his trap. See the fans that tap out
Thats wrestler shit. Dont rest your case
With the gaze just cause you wrestled your bitch
We catching bodies and catching fades in the hotel lobbies
Fuck the security and thats at the Ritz Carlton
My impurity is probably your best asset
Spit ass, hit your block and chrome and your address
Leave em stagnant
This is torture when I scorch ya
Or escort ya out the building with ex-convicts
And all sorts of criminal handshakes
Your man cant stick to the script
With handpaint. Poppin your lip, then poppin the clip
Then poppin your van, wait
I want the peace. But keep the piece
That I was Malcolm to your belief, wassup
Ayy, let me hear that ho, Jeff
Bitch come here, I love money, get this shit clear 
I will park yo ass 
Dont make me park yo ass 
Ayy
Bitch come here, I love money, get this shit clear
I will park yo ass 
Dont make me park yo ass 
Ayy
Park him on the spot, park him if he say he hot
Park him while his friends watch
I am everything you not
They say shame on me, I got the underground on lock
Thats what hoes say, thats what the bros say
I tell a freak bitch, Baby, lets roleplay
I like the kinks bitch, fuck me til the OJs
I mean my chain a woo-sah, I mean my game a woo-sah
I want some head in my new car, bitch, I dont care who drive by
You know I could make you famous
You know life bring changes
Shit, I changed locations soon as that big bag came in
Thats a mighty fine ass you got
Thought I forgot?
I can make the play and cash it out
Thought I forgot? Whoa
Bitch come here, I love money, get this shit clear 
I will park yo ass 
Dont make me park yo ass 
Ayy
Bitch come here, I love money, get this shit clear
I will park yo ass 
Dont make me park yo ass 
Ayy
Lyrics from Snippet
Dont grip on possessions, thats one of my lessons
Its never been that deep, I cant be desperate
I turn to Alexa, when I cant find Alexis
This feel like a rainy day in Texas
Lyrics From Snippet
-was our philosophy
Oooh, nani nani 
No bitch in my body, but
Your bitch in my lap, uh
Backwards at Pilates
Back to back that voodoo got-
Im on Union Square
Kendrick Lamar, violin, we take it there
Me and my man, no one compare
Thats like two left shoes, you fools
Im so rude, my flow is so crude
Spit at the mouth, foam and drool
Im on top of the world, Im on my pedestal
Looking under your girls dress - now thats a mess
Lift my flows like I flip your wife
And pass it to Sounwave down the way
You know hes nice
ADHD, producer, recruit ya
To the armies ?
Take a nigga to war
You know how Im about to settle the score
Kendrick, Ramal spelled backwards
Come and get me, youre nothing but target practice
Youre actors, coming at you with my flows
Like acrobatics. You never can stride into Compton
You get stomped on, what is youre talking about?
You dont want none..
Brodie! I just wanna say something right now bro
I once knew this girl named Mandy May
Used to see her on campus like everyday
I said her booty was the biz, gotta think Im sprung
She got me diggin in my pockets gettin her hair done 
She like to ride in the two seat she move right
Shes so cool Regina King of the boondocks
Shes educational, Brain like a circuit
Simon forward to anatomy class shes so perfect 
Roxy in a Reynolds wrapped on with a skirt on
Sorority sisters never seem to be virgins
What do I say the day I have to meet her father?
Ive been chillin in your daughter since you sent her to college, sir
Cowgirls style is Daisy Dukes and Gucci boots
The good girl to like the bad guy and whos who?
We made a touch screen, video, and bluetooth
I guarantee at least a million hits on Youtube
And I aint lying momma you the truth
Im talkin fly Ill need a parachute to marry you
 2X
I swear the college girls is crazy man
I really hope it aint your lady friend
Cause I got her, And she want it
And Imma give it, the frat boy is going ham
Now take a picture, fill up the DJs cup
And keep spinnin, one week to graduation!
Welcome to college
Where professors and the girls give you knowledge
Ironic, The only place youll find it
Men wanna hit the chronic and the girls be bondin
But Im on a liquor gettin cells like Im Sonic
Girls want a nigga cause Im gettin iconic
And Im in
To gettin hella paper like a saw mist
Find me, in your girls dormitory
And if its bedtime you already know the story
Stressin her like a deadline
I be on your campus and your chicks be buggin me
Like a praying mantis
So Im only laughin when chicks is gonna go hard
D cups and straight As on report cards
Find me in the yard like 36 inches
Chicks on my wood cause you niggas on the benches
Trynna get commas, like a split sentence
Cause when my song leak, college girls be drinkin it
 2X
Livin like a student
Im Drinkin and smoke pollutin
The campus is stampin my signature
Im sittin with her!
Her sister is a freak and her cousin is quite petite
And her auntie is thick dont trip her daddy is a minister
And Im a menace so I jump in it and stick my junk in it
Killed it like I had dumped in it with a AK, Mayday!
With all due respect Im askin you for some leg
She said her major was basic, I said my major was sex
She asked me for my number then hit me off with a text
Then we hit it of on her dormitory steps, then we slept
In the library, I dont know how we got there
I just know her name, Carrie
And Block! Her hair was red, Yeah
My head is spinnin from the sippin and the light bulbs
I think I picked up the wrong cup Im so gone
She got my hat on, sneakin out the back door
Freakin in the sheets while her roommate is in the dorm
The best performance and the greatest not in my life
We had a good time, but we dont start fights
Cream all the clothes, Adidas shell toes
Cell phones full of memories, peep shows
Its 3, its 3, 3 in the mornin, mornin
And every, everybody yawnin, yawnin
Yeah, we had a good time
I had a good time
We at the frat party
Sometimes, I look in the mirror
And ask myself, what Im scared of
How dare the media portray me this way? I can hear the
Crowds screaming the weirdest of chants
They all in my era or thats an error
Role model, I cant, its like Im a parrot
Apparently, Im marking the dance
I seen done with the devil such a ghetto romance
Here I go questioning everything I do, yeah
Then I found you, would this be cool?
Should I give up? Should I be through?
Thoughts keep running through my head
But something inside of me is making me believe
That I can do anything, do anything, yeah
When I look-when I look in the mirror
I see the hero inside of me
And I feel no fear, no fear, no fear
Im flying the way Im supposed to be
Looking for a feast but we can find out
And I can see my reflection when I look in the mirror 
Looking for me, what do you see?
What do you see?
Take your shit, thats what I wont do 
Out here doing what I want to 
You do what you cant
Thats the difference, Im a motherfucking man 
Well indite, I wont take that
Out here doing what I want to 
You do what you can 
Thats the difference, Im a motherfucking man 
Time and time again, I find myself
Inside the cerebellum of several felons
Orions Belt couldnt live in my world
I seen tigers, lions let loose and spooked
Im next door to Earl
I guess I rely on Jesus to save us
Before our referral to man as my neighbors
Witness ski masks, the masses dont know
Im packing this four and harassing your ho
Now, Im done searching for answers
Thinking of medicine I need to know
When its over, will I know?
Should I hold on? Should I let go?
Sometimes its better off unsaid
But something inside of me is making me believe
That I can do anything, do anything, yeah
When I look-when I look in the mirror
I see the hero inside of me
And I feel no fear, no fear, no fear
Im flying the way Im supposed to be
Looking for a feast but we can find out
And I can see my reflection when I look in the mirror 
Looking for me, what do you see?
What do you see?
When I look-when I look in the mirror
I see the hero inside of me
Now you got a body
But what I love most is how you put
Put your lips on top of me
You gots to be the baddest bitch Ive ever seen in my life
Wait!
Your girl look better than you
You know what that means, Im done with you
Bye!
Imma go hard, so fucking hard till I break the blood vessel out my motherfucking arm
Whip the wood grain, whip the wood grain till I break the blood vessel out my motherfucking palm
Break the blood vessel out their motherfucking eye everytime I ride by and theyre looking at the charm
I laugh at em like that, with my seat laid all the, all the way to the back
And the heat lay right, right, right under that
Clap, clap, brr, brr, thats the sound of my gat
Thats the sound of a 100 round drum, like a marching band, Im a stand up guy
Imma pump my fist, Imma wave my hand until I get the attention of the president, pussy
Presedential suite, laying in, laying in nothing but money
With a dove skin bitch laying on the side of me
Reminds me of Buffy, please remind me to fuck her after this freestyle
100 carat, nigga Im the golden child
Full metal jacket, shit, going pow, pow
Blow your brains out, let it hang out, let the neighbors talk about it, then skip trial
Wow, Im amazed by how you niggas talk about youre married to the game, aint took a vow
Ill fuck em up, cut em up, shoot em in the foot, or just gun butt em up
Now, Im on some other shit, we aint on the same page
You aint sticking to the script
Let a 100 round clip stick to your lip like Carmex
Shoot up your whip, fuck your tire, leave your car flat
Blood or crip, I dont give a fuck bout none of that
All of yall can get it, homeboy, its more than rap
Training Day, I teach you niggas how to rap
I rap like I got angels on my back
God given, I never walk in the booth without the Holy Spirit
I dont write it
Off the top like a psychic
I kick, lyrics like Jet Li
Which produce money to put your boy on the beach
Shit, sand in my feet
Tell me what the fuck you know bout me
See, Im the man, tell em roger that
I got bitches shattering glasses trying to holla back
My pockets fat, if not they getting there
Thats VIP, nigga, youll never get in there
See, I inspire conversation with dollar signs
You either talking money or just remain the mime
She got a fat ass with an amazing mind
That mean great brain
I swear to God every time I pop off that I pop a vein
Now aint that true love?
I tell her kill Cupid and give my crew love
And you aint getting it til you get in that jew love
Im talking Seinfeld, Ben Stiller, Wall Street, bank tellers
Tell em you couldnt bury with two cups
Papa need his courage or face eternal extortion
I harbor around the orbit on my Darth Vader
Youll see the light saber dropping jewels, Marc Jacobs
You know
Im whatever the streets made, the saint
The renegade the chain on the timid slaves
The dead on the corner, the van of the coroner
The ambulance first-aid, the criminals crime wave
The dominate at point guard, the drugs on the schoolyard
The kid on the go-cart, the bucket that wont start
The ruckus that wont stop, the city that hate cops
The niggas thats fed up, shoot and shake cops
The obstacle war block, the feeling of victory
The friend, the enemy, the positive energy
The negative force that forces you to sip Hennessy
And sin like a sinner that exempts all sympathy
The churches that God built, the verses that I killed
The curse that the devil gave, the start of the end of days
The happy and afraid, they dap me and give me praise
But were nothing alike, see I am life, motherfucker
And everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am
Its a few things you wont understand
And so I say comprehend the best you can
Got damn, everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am
Got damn, everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am
Im the seven-headed monster brought on by revelations
The evil conscience temptation that makes you wanna start hatin
The fallen angel mistaken, now you think that he Satan
The reservation Im dating, the devil infatuating
I am the groupie that knew she liked to go fight with her parents
Now its loosely apparent that she gets loose, now a parent
I am that child support that says nah, nigga, you stuck
You shouldve never have fucked, lost money over a nut
Her pussy came in the clutch, that VC wasnt enough
Her plan A was a A+, a plan B, never had one
I am the robber of the gun, I am mistakes, I am strife
Of course not, were not alike, see, homie, I am life, motherfucker
And everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am
Its a few things you wont understand
And so I say comprehend the best you can
Got damn, everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am
Got damn, everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am

Walkin down the block, K in my hands, fuck it, who want it?

Motherfucker, we will fuck ya
Spray your coupe and leave smoke in it like Chris Tucker
I’m no gimmick, we smell out the timid

We hard bodied, yall bodies ain’t like ours
And if yall bodies was then yall be built for war

I am a sinner whos probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I dont understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Trick, dont kill my vibe!
Trick, dont kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today Im yelling
Trick, dont kill my vibe! Trick, dont kill my vibe!
Trick, dont kill my vibe! Trick, dont kill my vibe!
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me its painless
You dont know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me thats amazin
To you thats a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner whos probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I dont understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Trick, dont kill my vibe! Trick, dont kill my vibe!

I would share it, but today Im yelling
Trick, dont kill my vibe! Trick, dont kill my vibe!
Trick, dont kill my vibe! Trick, dont kill my vibe!
Im tryin to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
Youre tryin to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And Im lookin right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This sh- is vital, I know you had to
This sh- is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
Ill let the people know this is somethin you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
Ima break out and then hide every lock
Ima break out and then hide every lock
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me thats amazin
To you thats a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner whos probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I dont understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Trick, dont kill my vibe! Trick, dont kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today Im yelling
Trick, dont kill my vibe! Trick, dont kill my vibe!
Trick, dont kill my vibe! Trick, dont kill my vibe!
Trick, dont kill my vibe!
You aint heard the Coast like this in a long time
Dont you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
Ill take your girlfriend and put that -sy on a pedestal
Trick, dont kill my vibe! Trick, dont kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream its alive
My New Years resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherf-in much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say Trick, dont kill my vibe! Trick, dont kill my vibe!
Trick, dont kill my vibe! Trick, dont kill my vibe!
Ayy, K-Dot, get in the car!
Come on, we finna roll out!
I got a pack of blacks and a beat CD
Get yo freestyles ready!
Yesterday my nigga had told me his brother died
A day before that his homeless uncle was cold outside
A week before he seen the cancer in his mothers eyes
Two weeks before that, couldnt pay his rent cause he lost his job
A month before that he lost the custody of his daughter
Six months before that her mother said she wont see her father
And this before he did a year when them charges brought up
I shook my head, turned around then found a $100
I dont know why You keep blessing me
I dont know why You keep blessing me
I dont know why You keep blessing me
I dont know why You keep blessing me
I dont know why I dont know why I dont know why
Yesterday I invaded privacy of a home
The day before that my partner had fronted me a zone
A week before I had loaded bullets inside that chrome
Two weeks before that I shot them bullets and he was gone
A month before that I cursed my mother then slammed the door
Six months before that I hit my woman, she hit the floor
I stormed out then seen a black Honda Accord
Them hollow tips missed me then hit that little boy
So today I laid in my bed, stared at the ceiling
Closed my eyes then asked myself how I was feeling
I analyzed on how a saint can play the villain
Is my life coincidental or just God willing
I came to grips, jumped up, and looked out the window
See my nigga had that same little boy that didnt know
Bullets is nameless, I guess this is meant for
Me to give them a $100 then trash my pistol
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why, now I know why, now I know why
So I can bless you
So I can bless you
So I can bless you
Lord help me
Cause I need You
I know this weed is burning
And Im on drink number two
But its all to soothe the pain from this
Cold, cold world
Sometimes I think You can help me
But this bus here is temporary
So Im talking to You
This sick world will drive a sane man crazy
Birds dropping out the sky, daughters having their fathers babies
And this the news I hear
When my god kids, nieces, and nephews turn a year
I wonder, will it get better
A little cheddar, when it get better
But the rest of thats cash
Make last years Christmas gift you, my bad
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow, but somehow, but somehow
If I just keep the faith
I know Youll be right there
Sometimes it may not seem that You are there
But Youre there
I feel Youre there
Youre everywhere
And I thank You for
Protecting me in these streets
From danger seen and unseen
I never know
What happened the night
I wasnt there
Something told me leave so I left
It was the next morning
Three got shot after the club
All listening to that small voice
Oh you saved my life
You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mamas cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard me
My gun got many ways to get you
You get hit with a missile and live, you would need barbed wire to stitch you
This is not fictional, this here is typical
I will bring it to your door if you cant see the visual
Black Manson, wont you ask him
How I have sex with the trigger just to make the barrel orgasm
Remember when it started, nobody protected me
Had to make way for school in the mornin and niggas sweatin me
Where you from? Like shit, Im tired of niggas questionin me
Now Im in, I gotta have that thing next to me
Went to my pops closet
The next day Im pullin up my pants, grabbin my crotch and walkin awkward
Somethin pop off, then I have somethin to spark with
By the bus stop like man I wish somebodyd push me
Imma let the hawk spit, with a killin instinct
Like some of these students gonna have an early coffin
You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mamas cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard me
You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?

You heard me, you heard me
Now I got a love Jones for that still on
Michael Jackson niggas, the fifthll change your skin tone
Sniper gunsll chirp 
Theyll prolly chirp silent when your Nextel is off speakerphone
How real is that? Never
Now niggas do dirt in daylight cause the is clever
I resign to the fact, that any where the drama is at
Im reclinin 
Keep your wordplay intact
And 50 couldnt say it better
Cant find you, show me where his mama live at
You a gangsta, Im not one, but it doesnt mean
By all means, Im not very able to pump a shotgun
 and watch as you 
With the MAC or the Ruger, nigga I got options
So while you play possum, I sit and watch em
Creepin, Nas got his so you fucked if you dont got one
You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mamas cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard meYou can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mamas cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard me
I dont know about you, but see, baby Im ruthless
Try to fight me, and see, baby youre useless
Shots from the MAC do more than have you toothless
The sound is exclusive, bang bang bang, boom
I explode like a Vietnam bomb
Hotter than firemans but my hand got a firearm
Fire at your arm, titty, and hands, breakin your palms
Usin them to snatch purses the brand of Louis Vuitton
Nigga, what type of shit you on? Its simple mass destruction
Revengeance, tension, you see Ive had enough
Did I mention? I sniff you pussy niggas out
The smell that you bring has aroma like an incensce
Play matrix, see if you the one
Its a million ways to die and this here is number one
And thats starin down a barrel of a gun
After I smack you til its gun powder on your tongue
Cause boy them shells get hotter than the sun
And boy when I spit, please be prepared to run
Boy, dont forget to have a vest when I come
Cause Ill hit your chest and clog up your lungs mothafucka
You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mamas cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard meYou can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mamas cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard me

And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme

In a woman, is it in money or mankind?
Somethings got me losin my mind
Where you at? From the front to the back
Im lookin for you, I react only when you react
I thought I found you back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the dirtiest pistol
Maybe youre in a dollar bill, maybe youre not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe Im paranoid, ha, maybe I dont need you anyway
Dont lie to me, Im suicidal any day
I could be your advocate
I could speak for you if you tell me what the matter is
I could preach for you with the mighty tongue
Im the one, how can I overcome
Negative energy, more like infinity, and survive?
I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish these
Hope it aint too many feelings involved
I see niggas in this bitch stuntin, poppin bottles
Gettin drunk with these bitches, and when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch and really dont know much about her
When you really should sleep with a choppa cause you gon wake up and see me with some choppas
I be with bitches that be with bitches that be with niggas with riches
I tell em, Get him, they say, Yes, daddy, and they dont care how we split it
And they so pretty, and their hair lengthy, he hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs, its a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin so silly, I smoke color purple, Im up in here feelin like Celie 
Nappy-ass dreads, whats that you say? Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli 
You can get snaked, you can get faked out by the bitch that you feelin
Cause you thought that she was an angel, that bitch aint no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tell her your business, she tell me your business, you tell that bitch what you feelin
All of the beans you be spillin, to you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillins
She know where you hide to tell me where its hidden, she know when youre gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics, and meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with you
So she dont get blamed, we dont snatch chains, we find out addresses, and we dont leave messes
Youll only know that its gone when you checkin, then your first thought is to start second guessin
She say, Whats wrong? He say, Nothin, keep restin, she say, Whats missin? How you know somethin missin?
He scratched his head, she say, Get back in bed, then she gave him some head
Boy, you cant trust them bitches, and then she say, Ooh, daddy, ooh, woo
She say, Ooh, daddy, ooh, yeah, she took off his pants and his shoes
He opened his eyes and saw that barrel goin boom, nigga, yeah
I see niggas in this bitch stuntin, poppin bottles
Gettin drunk with these bitches, and when they leave, they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches thats with the niggas we followin
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind, and tell them hoes, Dont be so obvious
Mona Lisa, long hair, dont care
She handle the business and dont ever tell, she bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell em, Ooh, daddy, lets go to your place, and if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She dont want love, she just want her share, she feed him lies with his silverware
I know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears, and then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people, and they already know him, and then I call Liz, and she say he comin over
I say, Good girl, just remember what I told you, she say, Yes, daddy, I say, Girl, youre a soldier
So were waitin outside, we watched him pull up, and walk up to the door
And right before he knock, she open the door naked, they started French kissin, but he didnt see moi
She left it unlocked, they didnt make it to the room, so they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds, turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him
Piss a nigga off, shoot him dead in his frown
Nigga, turn around, I aint here to fuck around, I aint here to fuck around, caught you wit your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin hands up, Liz, thats enough, you can put your hands down
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her, she a good actress and you a dead actor
Youll be dead after we get what we after, if Liz call you daddy, we call her a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga, but think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she aint for me, nigga, and if you alone, she bankrupts you niggas
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga, she slip somethin in it, now faint for me, nigga
Then you wake up and see guns in your face, and Mona Lisa out of frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga, you fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
We take everything that you have til you dont even have an opinion, we have your attention
And now youre lookin down a barrel though, nigga, you more terrified than a Fatter Joe, nigga
Dont be a pussy for pussy, my nigga, dont be a asshole over pantyhoes, nigga, quit playin
She say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup and a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter, four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin at em both poppin up and take a picture, uh, probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon be admittin that he love her on his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin in the walls
And he diggin in it like he livin in it, make a new religion with it, man a nigga bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree, sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi? Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby, then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
Im a dog in the wind, Im a pit laughing, Ima call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and Im all jazzy, Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy, bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, dont you ask me bout a motherfuckin double-standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, thats a negative alone, but you sucked this dick, thats just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! You fuckin with Waynes? 
Bitch, gimme your phone! 
He on your fuckin ringtone? Is that the shit that you do? Touchin yourself, lookin at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin his interviews, I dont know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder, forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma, daycare after school and she never did charge you
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up, you know what, I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber Im plannin on aimin, goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, Im emotional cause Im in stress, Im not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers thats killin that pussy, Im killin myself
She say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah

On the dull gray door to Studio 2 of the L.A. soundlab where Top Dawg Entertainment makes the magic happen, two warnings are posted
The first one, printed on TDE letterhead and titled “Studio Rules, Bitch!!” reads like ScHoolboy Q wrote it, mostly because rule No. 3 is “Don’t touch, ask, or reach for Q’s weed.” The second sheet, also on TDE letterhead, is more serious. At the top, in black capital letters, it reads: “IF YOU NOT THE HOMIE, DON’T COME IN HERE.” At the bottom, in red letters: “DISREGARD THIS AND GET THE TIPS PUT ON YOU, HOMIE.”
The reason for the caution: On any given day, Kendrick Lamar might be in deep concentration working on the follow-up to his 2012 major label debut, good kid, m.A.A.d city. GKMC was more than a great album; it was a landmark event, a modern masterpiece to rival Illmatic, Reasonable Doubt, and Doggystyle. It’s an artistically ambitious, highly personal piece of work: a day in the young artist’s life, encompassing gang culture in his Compton hometown, alcohol, drugs, life, death, God, family, and the pursuit of a girl named Sherane, a “concept album” that managed to sell over 1.2 million copies while making zero creative concessions. It transformed Kendrick from an Internet sensation into an A-list rap star
The success of GKMC in 2012, along with Ab-Soul’s Control System and ScHoolboy Q’s Habits & Contradictions, made TDE—launched in 1997 out of Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith’s home studio in Carson, Calif.—the hottest new rap label around. With TDE, Odd Future, YG, DJ Mustard, Nipsey Hussle, and others all popping, L.A. has been reestablished as a vibrant rap city. The renaissance shows no signs of slowing this year, with acclaimed releases like YG’s My Krazy Life, ScHoolboy Q’s Oxymoron, and Ab-Soul’s These Days.... Still, GKMC remains the crowning achievement
“When I went back to my old high school, all these kids looking at me like I’m the real big homie, the same way I look at Jay Z, Nas, or Dr. Dre,” says Kendrick with a laugh, sitting in his luxury trailer at his Complex cover shoot. “You would’ve thought Michael Jackson walked through that joint off the excitement that they had.”But now that Kendrick, 27, is a hysteria-inducing star, the world is waiting to see if he can deliver twice. Expectations are high. After good kid, good simply won’t be good enough. Unlike GKMC, which Kendrick planned years in advance, there’s no cover art in mind for the follow-up. As for a title, Kendrick says he’s “flirting with ideas.” He’s been working primarily with TDE’s in-house producers, Tae Beast and Sounwave of Digi+Phonics, but has also gotten in the studio with Dr. Dre. He’s still just “getting his ideas down,” but so far Kendrick’s recorded 30 to 40 new songs for the album . He says he’ll be ready for a fourth quarter release
“Good kid set the bar,” says Terrence “Punch” Henderson, president of TDE and the crew’s resident rap history buff. “Today, that’s the album that you gotta compare your album to. Illmatic would be the comparison—it didn’t sell the most records, but that was the standard.”
It’s the cornerstone of Nas’ legacy, but Illmatic was both a gift and a curse. Critics and fans alike compare all of Nas’ subsequent albums to his 1994 debut and are never quite satisfied. Ditto for Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, DMX, Slick Rick, and other rap greats who burst out of the gate with classic albums. Although other legends—including Ice Cube, LL Cool J, and Kendrick’s Interscope labelmate Eminem—delivered strong second albums that arguably surpassed their first efforts, creating a worthy follow-up is one of rap’s greatest challenges
“Kendrick shook up the rap game, so anticipation for his second offering is through the roof,” says Nas. “Kendrick’s an album guy and the album artist has a whole different kind of value. Kendrick is going to be one of the most important writers of our time; dude’s a rhyming animal. Whatever he does will be appreciated, but at the same time he knows he has to bring it.”
Kendrick says there’s less pressure on him now than there was right before good kid came out, when he was admittedly “super nervous.” “I was on the tour bus going back and forth on the text with Pharrell,” says Kendrick. “I asked him, ‘You think they gon’ get it?’ And he told me, ‘Don’t ever doubt yourself again. Always be aware but don’t ever mistake your first mind, your input of where your heart is at.’”
Today Kendrick trusts that his creative process will lead him where he needs to go. “If I keep focusing on, ‘I need to make something better than good kid,’ it’s going to be just that,” says Kendrick. “That’s not challenging yourself. I don’t want to become that person reflecting on what has been done. What I’m doing now is the question. I’m only as good as my last word, my last hook, my last bridge.”To fully appreciate the impact of GKMC, consider the context it was released in. Of the 10 biggest rap hits of 2012, two were by Flo Rida, two featured Nicki Minaj rapping over EDM-style production , and one was “Gangnam Style.” For better or worse, Kendrick’s Interscope labelmate Chief Keef had become a scapegoat for a perceived decline in rap lyrics and the fetishizing of ghetto violence by the media. Weeks before GKMC dropped, rap news was dominated by fights between G-Unit and MMG’s camps at the BET Awards
Once GKMC sold 242,122 copies its first week, became the best reviewed rap album on Metacritic since Kanye West’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and discussions about the classic status of the album hit a fevered pitch, Kendrick morphed from a promising rapper to the face of “real hip-hop.” Not just because of his artistic achievement, but because his celebrity relied solely on his musical output—not beef, fashion choices, business ventures, or the other gimmicks that have seemingly become part of the standard package for nearly every rapper
After the album’s release, Kendrick’s life was a whirlwind of tour dates and unexpected controversies. He toured non-stop in 2013, playing college campuses, festivals, opening for Kanye West on the Yeezus tour, and going on the good kid, m.A.A.d city world tour. During his tour, as he traveled from Sweden to Belgium with little Internet connection, Kendrick Lamar unintentionally set the rap world on fireOn the night of August 12, 2013, Big Sean released the Kendrick Lamar and Jay Electronica–assisted “Control”—a song meant for Sean’s album, Hall of Fame, but left off due to sample clearance issues. On Lamar’s earth-shattering verse he called himself the King of New York, a claim he shies away from now: “I feel B.I.G. and Jay will always be the King of New York.” More important, Lamar called out nearly every rapper in his generation—from A$AP Rocky to J. Cole and even Big Sean and Jay Electronica—and claimed, “I got love for you all but I’m tryna murder you niggas.”
By the next day, “Control” had taken on a life of its own. Instagram was overrun with “Control” memes, storm clouds of rap debates gathered, and thinkpieces poured out—even legendary NBA coach Phil Jackson, who was mentioned in the verse, got in the mix, tweeting at Kendrick. Just about every rapper, whether they were mentioned in the song or not, commented on the verse or dropped a response track. TMZ ran up on any rapper they could find, trying to goad them into responding. The week of the song’s release, Kendrick picked up 208,000 new Twitter followers
Rappers are supposed to want to best each other—“I’m better than him” sums up rap’s competitive mantra. But “Control” proved something contemporary philosopher Slavoj Žižek once argued about Wikileaks, what he calls “the paradox of public space”: “Even if everyone knows an unpleasant fact, saying it in public changes everything.” By naming names, Kendrick’s verse was the moment he asserted his dominance in rap. Earlier that year MTV had named Lamar the Hottest MC and Complex declared him the Best Rapper Alive; “Control” was when Lamar’s status as the best coalescedIm only as good as my last word, my last hook, my last bridge.One rapper Kendrick didn’t mention in his “Control” verse was Macklemore. At the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, Macklemore’s The Heist beat Kendrick’s GKMC for Best Rap Album. Although Kendrick was nominated for seven awards, he went home empty handed, while Macklemore won Best New Artist, Best Rap Album, Best Rap Song, and Best Rap Performance. For fans on Twitter and members of the media , Macklemore’s wins and Kendrick’s snubs served as a watershed moment for cultural appropriation in rap. To make matters worse, Macklemore Instagramed an apologetic text he sent to Kendrick after the awards that read, “I robbed you.”
“It wasn’t really a huge deal for me,” says Kendrick, who’s known Macklemore for over a year. “Macklemore deserves the accolades. That’s still my partner regardless. He probably didn’t need to Instagram the text. But what’s done is done.”
Like Macklemore’s success, Kendrick’s comes after years on the independent grind. In 2003, when he was 16, Kendrick dropped his first mixtape under the moniker K-Dot. He released three more mixtapes before reverting to his government name and dropping the Kendrick Lamar EP in 2009. Over the next two years, with his mixtape Overly Dedicated and his independently released first album, Section.80, he found the voice that made GKMC a classic. But Kendrick’s acuity with words predates his musical output“My first-grade teacher flipped out because I wrote the word ‘audacity’ in a story,” he recalls. “I knew the word only because I heard my auntie and uncles arguing, saying, ‘You got the audacity to take my motherfucking drink and pour it out?!’ I learned all my words like that, so when I went to school it was in my head.”
Kendrick’s perspective on life always comes back to his Compton roots. His upbringing provides him with a treasure trove of traumatic experiences that give his music a sense of purpose. On the lyrical blackout “m.A.A.d city,” he describes seeing a “light-skin nigga with his brains blown out.” Around age 5, he witnessed his uncle’s murder. In conversation, he casually recalls yet another murder, when he called his friend Yo to the barbershop just before someone shot up the block, killing one of their homeboys
GKMC apparently only scratched the surface of the stories Kendrick has to tell. “There were so many things I thought he was gonna talk about in good kid that he didn’t,” says Kendrick’s manager Dave Free, who remembers the days when K-Dot couldn’t be spotted with a backpack, lest he be labeled a conscious rapper. “All these other stories, shit that will blow your brain, have never been heard before because they’re just too personal. There’s still so much to be said. The question is, is he gonna say it?”
Whether or not Kendrick tells those stories could go a long way toward determining if he’ll be able to top his major label debut. “I got a greater purpose,” he says. “God put something in my heart to get across and that’s what I’m going to focus on, using my voice as an instrument and doing what needs to be done.” The only place to do that is back in the studioFor a few hours, Kendrick can forget about his next album. He’s back in Studio 2 working on a guest verse for Jay Rock’s upcoming album. According to Dave, a typical Kendrick guest verse costs $250,000. They once charged $400,000. He’s had some of his best moments on other people’s songs: trading bars with Eminem on “Love Game,” introducing an R&B flow on Robin Thicke’s “Give It 2 U,” stealing the show on A$AP Rocky’s star-studded “Fuckin’ Problems”—a song originally made for GKMC but given away because it didn’t fit the narrative arc of the album
Kendrick gets to the studio at 3 p.m. and sits on a black couch in the lounge area playing Jay Rock tracks on his MacBook. He sports a navy blue Detroit Tigers hat, white T, gray sweats, and, for the third day in a row, a pair of blue Nike Roshe Runs with white polka dots. A gold and black painting of Snoop Dogg, with the lyrics to “Murder Was the Case” inscribed in cursive, hangs behind him. He turns the TV to an episode of South Park but keeps the volume down and doesn’t even glance at the screen. Eyes fixed upon his computer, he listens to the music with his elbows on his thighs and his fingers interlocked. He rarely blinksAfter about 15 minutes in the lounge, he moves into the studio and connects his laptop to the speakers, playing Jay Rock’s verse over and over, flipping around tracks, and sipping from a bottle of water. Later he’ll chomp on an order of volcano salmon sushi. He tends to eat healthy—salads, baked chicken, lots of water. He plays basketball twice a week because, as Jay Z once said, rapping is “like an exercise.” And unlike many rappers—including his TDE labelmates ScHoolboy Q and Ab-Soul—he rarely drinks and doesn’t smoke or sip lean. All the homies know not to bother him when he’s busy in the lab. Sometimes he kicks everyone out of the studio so he can play instrumentals all night long, alone. He’s been known to cut off his phone for months at a timeGod put something in my heart to get across and thats what Im going to focus onPunch describes Kendrick as a “mad scientist” in the studio, but watching him at work, nothing seems erratic. If anything, he’s supremely calculating; the song slowly builds as his process unfolds. Kendrick stands around mumble-rapping to himself with his right index finger extended, like he’s pointing out each syllable as if it passes by on an imaginary teleprompter. He scribbles his verse on a small notepad that sits above a mic compressor. After about an hour, his verse is written. He takes a break, checks his email, and chats in the studio a bit before grabbing a studio engineer and getting to work. The engineer dims the lights and starts looping up the beat. Kendrick hums the verse to himself a few more times before he’s ready to rock. Then he heads around the corner to the boothIn the booth, Kendrick is a case study in precision. He raps with his eyes closed and his hands out as if he’s casting a spell, rapping about “restricted territories” and “Percocet headaches.” On the first few takes, his voice sounds closer to his normal speaking voice than his agitated extraterrestrial rapping voice. He’s rhyming slower than usual, taking his time to enunciate each line. After about five takes, he steps out of the booth and returns to the pad and paper he left on the compressor. He edits the verse on paper, scratching out some lines and writing new ones. But when he goes back to the booth, he leaves the paper behind“In the past, he never wrote down anything,” explains Sounwave, who produced “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe.” “Every now and then he’ll write down stuff, just for insurance purposes. He rehearses the song over and over in his head so he can get the full feeling.”
Kendrick returns to the booth and slams the door shut. He does a couple more takes but keeps flubbing one line halfway through the verse. He steps back and paces around the booth, repeating the lines over and over as he internalizes the verse’s structure. Then he looks up and says, “All right, let’s get it.” That’s when Derek “MixedByAli” Ali, Kendrick’s regular engineer, walks in and takes over
“Watching Kendrick is like watching a master chess player playing five games at one time,” says Ali. “He can do five songs in one day. He’ll start one song, then he’ll be like, ‘I’ma start on this.’ ‘I’ma go back to the old song.’ ‘I’ma start on this.’ There’s just so much going on in his head.”When Im in the studio Im looking for a feeling I havent felt. Its a high.Back in the booth, Kendrick is close to his 10th take. He hasn’t perfected it yet—some takes have better cadence, others have better breath control. He repeats the process over and over to pinpoint exactly what he wants. “Keep that one,” he tells Ali, “I’ma do one more.” After about a dozen takes, his voice opens up and his words start to crackle. He blurts the word “bitch” into the mic with the spontaneity and violence of a sneeze
“It’s not like, ‘Watch me get it in one take,’” says Sounwave. “It’s like, ‘Watch me get the best take.’ Sometimes we have a song complete and he’s like, ‘Nah, my tone on that.... Redo the whole thing.’ He redoes it and it’s like a different song now just because of the tone that he switched up.”
After 30 minutes and 15 takes, Kendrick proclaims that the mic is “hot,” ready to catch his voice perfectly. Having used a light mix for reference initially while he figured out his vision, he asks Ali to give him a live mix, which sounds closer to the completed version, in his headphonesKendrick’s idea of what this verse should be is coming to fruition. Each take is sharper. He’s getting more animated in the booth, his head jerking as he screeches past each word. After about the 20th take, he’s satisfied enough to hop out of the booth to review. He keeps editing the paper but casually remarks that he’s done. It’s 5 p.m. and he’s on to the next
Like the human distractions Kendrick keeps out with a sign on the studio door, he doesn’t let fear enter his creative space. “This is truly a blessing from a higher power,” Kendrick says, “and as long as I understand that there’s really no limitations to what I can do. Everything is forward with me. When I’m in the studio I’m looking for creativity I haven’t matched yet, a feeling I haven’t felt. It’s a high. When you look at people like Jay Z, Nas, Dr. Dre, these people are established, but they love music and they love that high. You always want that feeling of creativity.” And with that, Kendrick Lamar politely excuses himself. He’s got work to do

Dont wait too long
I dont wanna wait til the moments gone
I dont wanna play that same love song
Over and over
Started out good ended up bad
You like a pop song all stuck up in my head
Finally read the lyrics understood what they meant
When I spent all my money and my God damn rent
Now Im tryna figure out if it was worth it
Matter of fact I know the answer, it was no bitch
Chilling on the island with my feet up on the beach
But being raised on the beach couldnt prepare me for these bitches
And these sand sharks and how they try to sink they teeth in
Im just body surfing tryin not to hit the reef
All they wanna see a brother do is sink
But Im a ride this shit til my shit dont stink
Im a sing my heart out sing til I cant breathe
Im a mean every note even if its off key
Please go head and leave
I wouldnt wait for you so dont wait for me
If I didnt rhyme with Sony
Would you still wanna bone me
How come in the full room I can still feel lonely
My grandmama said watch out for them phonies
And them motherfuckers say its haters tryna be your homie
And you see you on top they want a little piece of it
But they aint getting nothin
Its going to my nieces and my cousins
Im having babies by the dozens
Pop em out the oven like an Egg McMuffin
Always up to nothing
But baby youre something
Like it when youre bumping down the street in your pumpkin
Wishing it was just you and me in the moment
Im thinking that its summer
Youre sipping the Corona and Im humming a song that you love
And you tell me that you love it
Just then we feel the buzz and our bodies start touching
Even though I know how it ends I dont want to interrupt it
Over and over
Like a record thats broken
Over and over
Like you say that were through
Over and over
Over and over
I came back to you
Now that its over
Oh no
Welcome to the story of my life, the mis-education of Kendrick
Stressin Hennesy shots throw em back like its vintage
Wondering can I live where is the generosity
Somethings just gotta give, tryna stay positive
My motives to be a mogul, searching for a dollar without compromising my vocals
Really Im just a noble kid from the westside of Compton
My cousins were selling crack while we play Sonic
You niggas is nonsense
I say that you full of shit
And need a colonic or maybe the Heimlich maneuver to throw up what you consume
My shine is bright enough to make a dead flower bloom in a room full of curtains
Im for certain that Im certainly popping the pistol verbally
And never will I get shot, your aim is all fucked up as if your sidekick dropped
Im nice with a... throw over and over again
You know who I do it for
Me, me
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Two-two, whats the deal homeboy?
Aye
Big money, big booty bitches, man that shit, we gon death of me
You see me on TV thinking oh, TDE got the recipe
I cut, call me K. Dot and this is Jay Rock and yall rest in peace
All the rappers they be talking about, bust right now we gon IP
Hold up, I said hold up
You thinking oh what? You cant talk about it
If you want to see us come around and move the crowds out
Because we got the loudest
L.A., we in the streets right here
Niggas seen God in projects
Everybody in this crowd right now, go and tell me about that prospect
Fall in this bitch
Like some good pussy, cant stand myself
So good, she so hood
She a cheesehead, patty melt
GED with some EBTs, and some DVDs
That shit was happening
She reel me in with some chicken wings
And some collard greens, that shit was brackin
Just cracked me a new bitch
Bust a new nut on her niggas jersey
My bitch get off at 9 oclock
So I had to shake her round 7:30
105, Im stomping fast
With these big guns, Im hella dirty
Get caught with this shit
I aint comin home til like
Yeah
Delinquent Mindz
Ayo, no eye has ever seen
No ear has ever heard
No mind has ever conceived
What God has prepared for those who love him
1 Corinthians 2:7-9
My nigga, what it look like?
Niggas hating, bitches hating, babies dying
Bullets flying, helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
Genocism, criticism, unemployment, racism
Burning buildings, AIDS victims, cancer killing no cure
Oil spilling, turmoil, poverty stricken, police brutality
Kicking ass of us Africans, hostages in Afghanistan
Not to mention another prison, child molesting
Cow intestines, botox injections, earthquakes thats government tested
Secret society weapon, opium plant manifested
Then turn to crack then invested amongst us Blacks just a message
To hold us back, great depression amongst Iraq, no direction no Google map
Just a Tec for the soo-woop swerving, izuzu then blap blap blap
Adolescents go coocoo, mothers are boohoo crying
The governor keeps us starving, these commercials keep us buying
These cigarettes supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph
Distincted livin with science, no place to live in, no Zion
See thats forbidden, we fryin
My nigga, what it look like?
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is homeboy
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is, tell them whats up!
My nigga, what it look like?
Malcolm laughing, Martin laughing, Biggie spittin
Pac is rapping, Gregory tappin, people singing, bells is ringing
Children playing, angels praying, 14 karat golden streets, collard greens
Red wine, potato yams, turkey legs...
...Culinary breakin bread
Children that were born dead
Bob Marley smoking while
Bernie Mac joking
Beautiful sculptures of Jesus, Mary and Joseph
Everybody floating, celebrating in thugs mansion
Michael Jackson dancing while J Dilla scratching
No taxes, no coke, no drugs, no pain
No hoes, no lust, no hate, no rapes
No guns, no fame, no stress, no lies
No bills, no deaths, no crimes, no kills
No debt, no cries foreal
No time in jail
No sick, no cash, no poor
No sins, no crack, no porn
Wont send your ass to war
Will you make it through the narrow door and see the good life?
Well if you do let me know what it looks like
My nigga, what it look like?
Lets start our program ladies and gentlemen
LETS GO!
NYC baby, haha we here now haha
Lets get it in
Watch her getting jumping like third grade barrettes
Let the beretta blow you die slow while I smoke on chron-ic
Try to throw salt homie like dry sweat gun powder flow through triceps
Im more advanced got a corvette flow, I spit like Murcielago
Through precipitation I give rappers a sun tan
Rapping like a promotional van when I pull the drum out
Clap more than a Beatle fan, never heard a sound like THIS
Im number one, youre forever number two like Siamese
This is New York rap on gold ds
Jay Rock proceed
Get it in like IVs
My flow is not on radar, the K-9 D
Play yall like chess, you cant check us, come correct
Or face a lyrical bomb threat
I bomb first like Makaveli in 9 6
The nine mili have you on your death bed sick
See really Im a project baby
Niggas are going Barney raised me
Crooked cops
Stop sign got a bullet whole, dont stop
Speed through it like a drag race, or get buried under the state
K.Dot
Expose niggas for who they are
Under their white T might be halter tops
Rap fags, the black mag come with a complimentary black mask
Black Jason, red beam on the Glock
Money talks, Im trying to have a life long conversation
Live like a silver spoon caucasian with a chain of hotel rooms across the nation
No home training, break 1,000,000 dollar vases
Here we go yo, here we go yo
I got the special kind of flow they call it Hip-Hop antidote
Murder MCs, if youre a rapper please check your pulse
 too late
 John Doe
Dead than a motherfucker, Damn Im a motherfucker
Let his Momma suffer
I ball like the West Coast at Harlem Rucker
But at venice beach, jump shots Im finna see
Fuck a drop top, thats how they killed Kennedy
Im in a bronco, OJ in the city streets
With my AC on 
Shit dont try to play me homes
Jump stupid, then ask to get filet mignon
Ima break him in half 
Spill out 
With the butt of the comb
I got a lock like riper
25 to lifers, walk in the yard and never fold in a riot
You know who we are, Top Dawg generals
I thank God for rap, my career was being a criminal
BLISS
New level Hip Hop
Where my shovel? Let me convince Nas
Dig a couple graves tell em that the new rap zombie is alive to invade
On the masses south central true best I
40 Glock stashes, buck 50 score left eye
Going back to Cali in a New York state of mind
I cant wait
You know, nigga aint never hopped on no, no subway train you know
Might catch the blue line or something
Metro Bus
125 St. down Rosecrans, 53 down central
Hahahaha, Its all new to us you know
Get out the hood for once
Statue of Liberty, I wanna see the fire on that motherfucker
The fire really burn in that motherfucker?
Heh, you see a nigga dont a nigga dont ever know and shit

Southern California
Crenshaw, gangbanging cant slang it

Get used to them L.A. cats, heh
Puerto Rican mamis, nigga dont got no puerto rican mamis, nigga we got Mexicans nigga
Straight up, haha
Its K. Dot, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, I said Philly
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh
Who say West Coast niggas dont know anything about real hip-hop?
Im bout to give you a prime example
Where my gangstas at? Where my dimes at?
Where my nickels and dimes at?
.45s Mac 10s and nines at?
9 times out of 10 half of yall will die in this combat
If its 12 of you, shells bubble like Alka-Seltzer
You wanna die? I can help you
Put the rap beef aside and the content of the street shit to the block, parental advised
Im feeling like Muhammad Ali in his prime
Mike Jordan in his heyday
Call me Jeff Gordon in that hard top swerving in between the lines
Im tryna see a better way, I still feel hatred
Uncle Bobbys still incarcerated, Grandma died in Vegas
Grandpa moved to Mississippi
I really cant tell if dude missed me
Probably stretched out on the floor, with an empty bottle of whiskey next to his earlobe
More reason why my heart cold
Prior to a lot of hatin going, Feds raided the studio
We tryna do songs, but they aint listen
They just kick down the door as if they have permission
Why you had to do that for?
I wish Pro Tools was on record
Wish I was sitting in the booth doing the chorus or something
No assumptions, I know Im nice
I know Im walking the path of greatness, no compass
Not Atheist, but the bars reside with Satan
Chokin the mic, releasing my frustration
Rather do that before I catch court cases
Locked up by Caucasians, claustrophobic
Boxed in like a new Porsche rollin
Stones on my wrist, iceberg, Titanic frozen
K. Dots in my colon
That nigga, Colon Powell
Modern day war victim
Oh, Im foul, come join my coalition
No snitch nigga, go join the co-defendant
Feel relentless, new apprentice
King of, comprehension
No competition
Comptons back, pump your fist like this and that
No sumbliminals, Im listenin, face the facts
Youre a disgrace to this rap business
Just a one-man office, you need assistance
Gun tucked, walk in the club, set off sensors
I am a senseless thug, with book smarts
And anybody wanna go at rap legends, without theirself to question
We gave you the self-motivation to be in this profession
Gave you the rhyme scheme before your English education
Exclamation, put it in quotes
I say Im better than most that say theyre the ones that gave em swag
The flow, the artist development
Am I who gave you the growth?
You didnt bloom by yourself, somebody had to plant the seed
The sun shine, and now king me
The rappers rapper, the MCs MC
Kodak moment thats been captured, cheese
I said cheese
]
Previously
How the hell you gonna tell that man not to be violent?
Cause he dont need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin?
Shoot em both, Brady, wheres your gun at? Gunshots
]
Now kill yourself
Whyd you say that?
Cause thats the American way plus it was fun
Man, you a damn jack-
-ass I know everyone wanna make me the scapegoat
Like your the greatest of all time
Fuck you
Asshole
Lets stop the bickering
Thats the last time you see me ignorant
So you can kill the thrills of thinking were not different
Yeah, yeah, youre embarrassed arent you?
Couldnt control your arsenal
Maybe the next time Im persuading you, jump in the car pool
So whats your answer?
Man you must have your cracker
Oh no, another white joke, Im laughing, how original?
Youre asking for me to be on the shit that you on
Yeah, we can start with this cat named G Malone Static
Meet G Malone, a west coast recording artist thats destined for stardom, but acknowledging the false hopes that lie within the music industry, he ponders the thought of going back to drug distribution. Feeling unsure of this decision (DJ rock star
Exclusive)...
]
Hey G, remember me?
Its yo conscience
You know, the voice in yo head that never had fed your nonsense?
I know your getting famous and rather lifestyle is changing
But tell the truth
The music biz isnt what it seems, aint it?
Dont listen to em G
Keep putting Watts on the map
Fuck that
You been gettin money way before rap
I say you go back hustlin
Gather some sherm, pack, and a black magnum
Through Wyatts mad dog and a pit bull if it watched
Stop, no need to be moving backwards
Besides, your future brighter than half of these rappers
So whats the point of going back to the drug side?
Cuz everybody knows that Gs certified
What the fuck, you dumb as fuck
Oh, what, you jealous fool?
Cuz I know Malone, Keke Loc, and his brother Pool
Plus the Seventh Street-
Man you aint nothin but bad bitch
Aye, Malone, if your with it lemme get an ad-lib 
Meet Jay Rock, former quote unquote Menace to Society, now Warner Brothers recording artist dealing with the sudden uncertainties of even having his first official single released. He finds himself struggling, daily to overcome the temptations triggering his old criminal ways. At this moment, his conscience comes into play...
]
Watts finest
I told G he wit it
He said he bout to go OT
Forget it
I wont let you fuck up Watts career
Woah, calm down
Somebodys getting sensitive here
You fucking right because you know Jay Rock is my favorite
Man you got a song with Lil Wayne and still aint made it
Plus you just had a baby
So I know that shit is stressin
Know how much pampers cost ya
We live in a recession
I suggest you rob tomorrow
Whatever in sight, whatever you like
And if that bitch resists tell that bitch goodnight
Like thats gon make a difference
I know it will
What, prison?
Im just sayin what he like to do best
What?
Stealin, robbin, jacking guys for nice cars
Like the nigga did in 17
Did you say nigga?
It was a joke you know what I mean
I mean, I hope you know what I mean
Why you mad?
Youre acting mean
I mean, you said the same thing earlier
What the fuck you worried for?
I thought we was a team man
You trippin man
You glitchin
You dont get it
You was right
You are different
You fuckin right
Why the hells you gotta fuck with the future of Watts?
Okay, okay
Lets see the choice he makes before his album drops Static
What are you doing?
Watchin the sun.
Yeah? Why are you watching the sun?
I’ve always wondered why people say we shouldnt stare at this powerful source of energy. Made me curious.
What if you go blind?
Ive never heard of anyone goin’ blind from starin at the Sun.
Guess you got a point there. Have you seen anything yet?
Many things.
Like what?
See for yourself. You should turn off the phone.
Welcome to the present.
Too many opinions in the glasshouse
This world full of ego, let me cash out
Jump in that—, jump in that bitch 
Jump in that— , jump in that bitch 
Jump in that— , jump in that—
Jump in that bitch, run in that bitch
Jump in that-jump in that bitch
Two trench coats in the bag
Baby Keem, king of rap
And I think he just came back
How the fuck did I go back? 
Get your case off my back 
That my son, wait, relax 
Beat my son, go to your room 
Stop sneak-dissin, that aint bool
Play both sides, huh
She love all my guys, huh
As we grow up, we begin to identify with things . Which means, identify means, we divide all sense of who we are from certain things. When youre identified with something that you are not, it always leads to suffering and unhappiness.
I wonder what hes thinking about up there. Or if hes even thinkin’ at all.
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yo, I said back up on my body shit
Like I aint even body it
The Maserati doors flip back, like a karate kick
I got to get that and party with that
And prolly with the same ones
I come in this game with, Im Mobbin with
All my niggas thorough from DC, to Cali shit
V-A to P-A, to G-A to D-E, to D-A
Want to catch a nigga, seats and body slit
Circle so tight
Its even harder to get out of it
People say Im border line crazy
But Im proud of it,Everyday Im destined to be
They couldnt swallow it, the hollow shit
A double barrow pump
Will get him out of it
50 Caliber Magazines couldnt model it
A monument, I stand tall
Something like Im Solomon
Cop is trying to see my Facebook, so they follow em
All up on Myspace, the fuck out of my face
Been repping 52 ever since I was 58
56 to 52 the 40 divide you
According to Sky Blue, now he repping that Piru
Shorty is Pi too, He dont want it with my crew
You aint got to fuck with dennis rodman, to die dude
I play the side, they wanted me as pimping
I told Im a ball, somebody must have been tripping
Somebody must have been sipping
The same niggas looking at me now
Like damn I knew that nigga was shittin
But Im spittin real rap
Got a fake nigga shivering, cause all them punchlines
Hit the skies for the bitching, look at how we living
No chef up in the kitchen, but bitches be over three times a week making chicken
Learn how to rap in the hood, I seen a vision
Everybody slacked in the hood, but I had a mission
Now giving back to the hood is my ambition
So why I live back in the hood, be like an engine
I dont understand that, I dont follow, I be trending
Give a model my opinion, one that I aint even have to share
Black Suit, Vladimir, Pen stripe like the magic wear
Thunder Game, They think Im wearing the magic gear
Court side every game, that ass appear
After the game, Disappear, thats magic yeaah
Still fuck with the same niggas that got me here
And I even on yet, look at how im doin yet
Am I drawn yet? reading paper like a comic
Look at how they made the beat, look at how im on it
Corner-back, Im a quarter back catching all of that
Wide-receiver still running thinking that I love to bat
Uh, Hannibal Lector pressure inside my veins
You nothing but a tangible wrestler
Stressed to entertain, I intertwine
With rhymes, while circling candles in the rain
Cause a seance, call my great aunt
And tell her Im insane
I love the night life, Dracula, e-parasite, where my fangs
Knowing my vice, advice-giving by killers who obtain
Bullets and dice, gamble with it
Put dentures on your name
Price on your head
Sell it for cheap, like an eBay domain
Blucker, ey fucker ! my pedigree might fuck ya
No homo, take yo logo, and yo promo to an usher
To walk it down them church pews
I killed it had a curfew
A 6 p.m, a black p.m
Thats all they seen, I tucked a murder weapon in my brain
My nigga, you know the drama I bring
Clinically Saddam Hussein
While fucking on the Dom Hossain
Thas a famous bitch
Now tell me who you hangin with
Its a Privaledge
To fuck with Kendrick and Kevin durant on some gangsta shit
Shitted on em
Man
And I take my time, to write these lines
Only aliens can see the signs
Jupiters intruder, Im, looking for another universe to climb
Im still lost in my own zone in the living room
Like Im dead to the world playing Donny Hathaway
Patron shots I consume taking the pain away
Each sip bring me closer to my doom
Sun shining bright through the crack in the blind
Thinking to myself this morning what happened to time
Its passing away, the world decides, it aint what it used to be
Everything I love dont mean what it used to mean
For example spitting a 16
No thrills, feeling numb like im of Thorazine
It used to be nicotine, I was addicted to this rap thing
Now Im just trying to trap cream
Enough drowning in my sorrow, never put off tomorrow
What you can do today, thats my new motto
With that said, I roll out the bed
Hit the showers, its time to get this bread, now make dollars
I woke up in the morning, washed my body, put some clothes on it
After that, put on my heat like Alonzo Mourning
Cause everybody got a gun, its like theyre copy cats
So me without one is like Im dated
Id be out of style like Adidas and fat laces
Starter Jackets and dookie ropes or whatever the late 80s had favored
Im one of the best of my Homo Sapiens
One of the best of Gods creations
He shows favoritism everytime you hear the record on radio stations
I know you mad, you aint gotta say much, I can feel you hating
Serving mcs like waitress, Andre Agassi, multitalented
Rapper slash athlete, killing these niggas, theyre screaming in agony
Half of these niggas aint half of me
Half of these niggas aint talking bout nothing, yakity, yakity
Pushing my buttons like plaid shirts, clapping them rapidly
Actually, Kurt, Co-Bain
Ten years in my career, pray to God that I dont blow up my brains Lord, Im here
Great Depression, I dont know much, all I know is studio sessions, and how to get my bars up
They call me Subway sandwich the way i give them cold cuts
Cut from a different cloth, and these Yves Saint Laurent jeans;
They cost so much
 Usher
Either way im caught up in materialistic
Anything thats custom, best believe Imma get it
Getting tired of it and get rid of it, dont step on the Compton premises without your weap-on on your hip
The home of the stray bullet that murder the innocent
No matter the crime rate I still remain content
Moving at my own pace, cause if it dont make dollars
Then it really dont make sense, and if you cant comprehend
I holler like a rottweiler behind a backyard fence
 - x4
I woke up this morning, counting my cash
Girls calling me now, straight throwing the ass
I threw on my T, I grabbed my bitch
Laced up my chucks, rock sharp as a piece
They used to call me a creature, but now Im a beast
With my voice on the beat, Im the voice of the streets
From my head to the feet, Im bad to the bone
Nigga, I wont stop, till Im add to the throne
Dog, I ride with the chrome, gotta be safe in this shit
Call me Pharrell, boy, I keep me them Clipse
I dont ride on no skateboard, I roll with some grinders
Trapped in the hood, far from Giligans Island
I was a drug dealer, but now Im a wild spitter
Nigga, Im more iller, call me a hospital
You got the hiccups, I got this fluent as shit nigga
I spit a bar, straight ruin your shit nigga
Known as a mack, I can influence your bitch
Im the reason these niggas be handcuffin them quick
Im the reason these bitch niggas be playa hating on us
See them in the streets, these niggas dont be saying nothing
But keep on talking, you aint ready for beef
Jay Rock down to bust a nigga head in the streets
I cant help it, the hood flow through my blood
This gangbangin shit, should be considered a drug
Everybody doing it now, I see you rap niggas
Wrong place, wrong time, thats how you get clapped nigga
Raised in the projects, money my object
They standing in my way, like a frog I dissect them
Youll get shot walking through my section
Now you a verse all in my session, they say life is a school
Everyday is a lesson, well I get kicked out, shit got me guessing
Shit naw, check my ghetto report card, straight A student in every class up in the Gardens
Money over bitches, nigga im heartless
Money over bitch niggas, rich is my target

Reach my surroundings when I move out cause dudes envy
Something like Prince Akeem 2 in the semi
Super soak ya, anti-social, for the mail Ill go postal
Postpone your post put it on pause with no controller at all
Just a nickel plated fo-fo, pockets got a melody, carryin notes
Without bad breath, still carry the scope
I infrared whoever infiltrate, or disrespect, my money make it intellect, like a safety you intercept, a chain of bullets
They vics when they rubbing your chest, pincher
I treat all beef tender, no shook ones around here son
You like Michael Jay Fox when them bad boys come
Not Will Smith or Martin Lawrence, Im talkin bout boys thatll surely inspire your life insurance, life is short
Your reality is at the height of a dwarf
Say goodbye to the bitches and the champagne corks
Say hello to the ditches where your homies is tossed, in it
Porche blocks be black tinted, everything stocked
Catch me running over civilians, middle finger up when im removing the ceiling, dissect the whole block when im removing your building, this goes out to every man, woman and children
I dont discriminate, shook ones get earthquaked
Rappers are scared to death, theyre scared to look
Cause aint no such thing as halfway crooks
Niggas shook from the door like Who is dem boys?
Anything happen in front of it theyre responsible for it
Niggas play hardcore like they really want a war
Find themselves ductaped in the Ford Explorer
Like This aint even car ford, how I end up in this?
Walkin on the oceans floor at the bottom of the abyss
Im guttin you guppies up, take a nap with the fish
We dont wanna talk about it, we know where you live
Mattafact, we got pictures of your kids
Tryna talk himself out of it, but he dont wanna hear
What a mess, look at what you niggas did
Dig a hole, bury yourself, by a jump off the bridge
This no subliminal, you know who we is
Tried to do the snake thing, but we got to his ribs
Not the rib that protect his organs, but rib meaning his woman that be spending his fortune
Huh, hop out the frying pan scorching, right into the fire
Hitman for hire, Punch
When i be in the block, rappers, they get shook up
Cause what im holdin that get your soul took up
Blukah! Sound of the chrome plated woopa
House flyin straight to your medula, suit up
When its time for war, lace your boots up
My advice ; get your head bulletproofed up
No mercy, when the tool bust, smooch ya
Leave your ass asking for your future, who ya?
I dont know ya, gotta show ya, folding dough like yoga
Dont approach us, nurse bag get smoked fast like a penitentiary box
Of cigarettes, we still got that work posted on the ave
Nickle and dime bags of narcotics, I got it
You want it? No problem, still got the fiend shook like hydraulics
Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today…
I feel like
I feel like
I feel like
Bumping some shawty
Rollin my window down and hitting the highway
No its not Friday
But its my day
And sometimes shit gotta go my way
Niggas got me fucked up
Thinking that my music don’t stick like some nunchucks
Top dawg and we all stars like we run chucks
But never mind that
Take a trip to outer space show you where my mind at
You know where my grind at
Inside of the studio where I spend my time at
Fuck over the game til I make that bitch climax
Miss me with that bullshit haters die young
You can run to the poor pit
Pullin off the pit stop
Car like a flip flop
Bitches clap at me like they wanna make my piss hot
I don’t even trip doe I don’t need no company
Me, I’m thinkin long term tryna build a company
Kendrick the good kid
As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me
I hope that you do you I think to myself truthfully I can only feel later
Some people say that I’m rude but I don’t give a damn if she if he if them or they say
I’m uncool nothin but change how I feel bout me today
Nigga, what I depose be so potent
That if the earth dried I could spit back the ocean
Then hop on a jet-ski and start West-Coastin
I’m not boastin or braggin not a person I’m a dragon
Takin action in the heat of the night
So if the devil came tell him that I be alright
I’m so high off life that I can OD
Walk outside then sniff a whole key
Old lady done called the police
Its just an average Joe walkin with his heart on his Pendex
Don’t be afraid to speak
So to speak you niggas not within arm reach
Y’all midget Max swingin on Shaq now have a seat
You can never coexist with my momma’s oldest
Kendrick be thy name
I got my mind right
My nigga locked in the pin, thats what my mind write
Ink over my brain
Whats up
As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me
I hope that you do you I think to myself truthfully I can only feel later
Some people say that I’m rude but I don’t give a damn if she if he if them or they say
I’m uncool nothin but change how I feel bout me today
So let me start off the third verse
Pickin up your favorites is our curse
Fuck the system, fuck the truth, fuck religion
Fuck the government, fuck the law, fuck the prisons
Fuck George Bush, fuck rappers who love dissin
Fuck you because you don’t see my vision
I fucked your new girlfriend too
Because she’s cute and the ass
Looks like a grenade within the denim
Fuck the groupies, fuck the gossipin bitches
Fuck niggas that can’t fight so pull triggas
Fuck the new world gas price that cost a livin
Fuck your love fuck your hate fuck your snitchin
Whether you fuck with me or not

As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me

Words bouncing off my tongue like a damn trampoline
Hoes manicure him enough the bottom of my jeans so I kick him off
Got haters pissed off, used to have no bank
Look at my account, you see Os like Rick Ross

Parking my UFO somewhere that you dont know
Welcome to the C4
You see one you see four
Bombs in my peak hold
Bombs over Baghdad, son you niggas
You can never say I was a bad dad
Run you nigga like a marathon

In order to see the king you gotta swim through the ponds

How can I change the world, but cant change myself?
How can I please the world but not God himself?
How can I have the world, still need some help?
How can I see the world, stuck in this box?
Ive been trying to figure out my life
I cant see, even in plain sight
Though I cry, my tears dont bring light
Your life is in your rearview
How can I change the world, but cant change myself?
How can I please the world, but not God himself?
How can I lead the world when Im scared to try?
Why should I need the world? We all gon die
I thank God for giving us this life
The day youre born, someone else dies
All in love, all is in life
Your life is in your rearview
Your life is in your rearview
Your life is in your rearview
Your life is in your rearview
Your life is in your rearview
Your life is in your rearview
Your life is in your rearview
Your life is in your rearview
Your life is in your rearview
Your life is in your rearview
Uh, you know what it is
Ima make sure everywhere you go you see me, baby
You hear my voice?
I never had a problem with your old nigga
Its just how we mob, we dont know a nigga
She put me in her past and she moved on
But I keep her sexy ass in my new songs
We all make mistakes, we gone fight
There to wipe a nigga tears in the late night
She wanna cum before me, tell her, Wait a minute!
Now we on the water, elevators in it
Dancing to another artist, Im the one who pin it
Ghost, with the most, see no competition
Working in the club and guess who gotta tip out
Long money, Ima show you just what Rick bout
Rims on the coupe, baby, haters wanna sue
Me and you against the world, what you wanna do?
What you wanna do? What you wanna do?
Frustration 
Hesitation 
Come closer baby 
One question: Am I moving too fast?
Cause I aint leaving alone- feel like I could be honest babe
We both know that were grown
Thats why I wanna know
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I dont wanna waste my time
Back of my mind, Im hoping you say two or three
You look good; we came to party
But I dont wanna waste my time
Temptation 
Sweet persuasion, oh 
Come closer baby 
Impassioned 
Aha, and what do we have
Your empty heart and my empty bottle and yellow cab
That you are likely to catch cause your latest ex made you mad
So I figured the perfect catch would be you if I made the pass
Pool full of liquor then we dive - in it
Knowing if I lick her I might die - in it
Then reincarnate as a fly - gymnast
Just to flip my tongue on you
This the Olympics
State your name, live in the moment
It’s your time to own it, I see it in you baby
She tell me that she never get a first let away
And life is a bitch, but every dog has its day
Holla pull up, pull up, bring it back, come rewind
Pull up them big trucks, that pack come behind
Pool full of liquor then we die - in it
Pull em to the side, let me slide up in it
Or waste your time, or waste your time
Or waste our time, baby its alright
Baby its alright, baby its alright yeah
Oh its alright now
Alright. Oh yeah
I dont wanna waste my time, no
I dont wanna waste no time, oh no
I dont wanna waste your time, babe
I dont wanna waste our time, Oh my time, Oh whoaaa, now
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me? 
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I dont wanna waste my time 
Back of my mind, Im hoping you say two or three 
You look good; we came to party
But I dont wanna waste my time
No-no-no. I aint judgin if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
What? More power to you if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
I aint judgin if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight

Business movin like New York City lights
Bitches all over that boy
Cause they know that young boy got a cold strut
But I dont fuck with them hood rats, theyll set you up
And I aint goin out just like that
Id rather go out over a shoot-out, plow
Land of the scandalous, every corner got a candle lit
Every stop sign got a hollow tip
Every sunshine got a hood under it
And you know we Marilyn Jones runnin that shit
My bones made out of cement, strong arm
Explode on yall, Vietnam, boom
Heh-heh-heh, okay, Im ready, ha-ha
Tell your boyfriend to do it like this
A thousand for the jeans, three hundred for the kicks, bitch
I was born with diamonds in my wrist
So, its only right for your boy to talk shit, yuck
Straight nasty, dont walk past me
I just might grab it, just might pull a blade out and stab it
I would kill it only if you say
Im more than willin to take advantage
Legs to the ceilin, ho, throw away your panties
Tell em that we chillin if your boyfriend harassin
I take em, then I perform magic
Head on the freeway, seatbelt fastened
And go and tell the DJ to play my shit
You never heard nothin like this, yuh
The new West Coasts best-kept secret
Chronic smoke comin out my throat, ha-ha
Shit, ay, ay, heh-heh, fuck it, Im goin in
They say, Who that? K. Dot, no roof, new top
They hate, they watch, speed down the block
In a Porsche Box, stashbox, got a new Glock
In a shoot-out with anybody that you got
.45, no lie, no problem
If he got his jewels on, Im a Black Rob him
Nigga, Im a bad boy, Im a black ski mask, boy
Im a run in his house, then ask, Where the cash, boy?
Tell me where the safe or thisll be the last time
That you ever have a gun in your face
Might be the last time that somebody run in your place
You picked a bad time to be at fuckin home today, stupid
Im ruthless, Im Eazy-E, Im Snoop, shit

Tell it to the Colonel Sanders, do it for that Compton campus
Heh-heh, Im done with the fourth quarter
Shit, psych, Rock, get em
Guess whos back? Fresh new fitted, turned back
Fresh new spinners on the Lac
Never knew Rock could do it like that
Im a mack for real, I hit more pussy than Vagisil, yeah
Who got this game in a chokehold?
Well make your best rapper submit
Pack up and quit cause we the shit
Plus, that Calico hold more shells than El Pollo Loco
Turn you to a dough salt
Take your ho to the mo-mo quick
She want to bounce up and down on my pogo stick
Me n Dot spit raw, deejays, Mr. Miyagi
Your records wax us on and wax you off, ha
You come frontin, get slammed like Onyx
We the West Coast classics, you better pay homage
You want problems? The kings of the shoot-outs
Leave your block smokin like a luau
Top Dawg E-N-T, bitch
We told you, heh-heh-heh, we told you, ah
Top Dawg, nig, we told you, nigga done did it
Yeah, yeah, aye
Pour up , head shot 
Sit down , stand up 
Pass out , wake up 
Faded , faded 
Now I done grew up round some people livin their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin to make a vow soon
That Ima get fucked up, fillin up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin only two or three shots?
Ima show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, Ima dive in it
Pour up , head shot 
Sit down , stand up 
Pass out , wake up 
Faded , faded 
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience
If you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that youre nauseous right now
And Im hopin to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
Ima drown in some poison, abusin my limit
I think that Im feelin the vibe
I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently Im over-influenced by what you are doin
I thought I was doin the most til someone said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin only two or three shots?
Ima show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, Ima dive in it
Pour up , head shot 
Sit down , stand up 
Pass out , wake up 
Faded , faded 
, nigga
If youve got a little Ima share a thought
You from Compton? Get your uncle, poppa
He a gangster, he know how to party
You aint nothing like him
You a stranger to this
G shit
Fuck a sip, nigga
Take it to the neck, nigga
Take it for the dead homies
Homie, just a set
This the business
Many bitches, alcohol
Deal with it
Be a Navy Seal with it
Swim until you feel 
Nigga, why you babysittin only two or three shots?
Ima show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch

Pool full of liquor, Ima dive in it
Pour up , head shot 
Sit down , stand up

Faded , faded
Hallelujah, K. Dotll do ya
Quicker than a porno star, jump on my dick yall
And get fucked by the millisecond
Duck when I pull the weapon from out of my mouth 
Shots at you like a sawed-off
Aiming for your grill like Im Paul Wall
Then peal til I not yall
My cerebral cortex is like a war vet
Sharing war stories with the deceased, Im brain dead
Straight bananas, I never gave a fuck
Bout anything but my momma, my daddy, siblings, and grandma
And if you neither one of them, then I gotta answer
Every question with a bullet hole in my hammer
Like VH1, thats far beyond your comprehension
Like a deaf person showing up to court for a hearing
Who they fearing? K. Dot
Tickle the nipples of women
Make your bitch grab her crotch when she hear my shit, bitch!
K. Dot got the unorthodox flow
On fire, make a rapper burn his soul
Murder for hire, acquire choirs for funerals
Numero uno, city in my rearview
Compton on my back like the titties of my masseuse
Pity, here you fool who?
Go against me, I rebuke thee
And wake thee up, six in the morning
With the pump, punks jump up to get beat down
Jump shot, coroners catch them on the rebound
Pans, pots, plates, bowls
Im in your kitchen eating your stove
Im hungry and hibernated
Im cold as Miles Davis
I load up then I aim it
No judgment for the plaintiff
It only gets more heinous, nigga Im brainless
Like a blind bitch who dont suck dick
Dinosaur manure, big shit
Smell me or die quick, fucka!

I can stand in a pool of gasoline lighting a blunt and never catch on fire
 Silly motherfucker, Im fire
Smack the devil over the cheek, gave him a third degree burn
Iced it down when he was asleep, and said youll be okay
A lot of rappers are desperate to be a star by the day
They hydroplaning, hoping that they get their big break
Im just saying, I feel Im the one
Like a magician with a stick inside his hand, or the name of a mexican
I gets ignorant with ya
Snap me a picture, bitch, Im famous
I came in this world nuts in my palm and drinking Paul Masson
In a stolen Cavalier like I took LeBron
Locked him in a basement and amputated his shooting arm
 Now thats a stretch Ab-Soul
Like a fifty mile strip when Im pimping these hoes
Call me Dolomite, nope I take that back
Found out he gay as a happy day or the way that you rap
(K. Dot got the unorthodox flow
On fire, make a rapper burn his soul
Murder for hire, acquire choirs for funerals)
Im more focused, see Im nothing like you new 
 the front lines
Thinking they hot cause they homies said they was a few times
Which is too many times of lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hours, these niggas better get they bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key, my cool is on, she love my AC
My jewels is on and I wish one of yall try robbing me
I shoot and have you laying between the sheets with the Isleys
We push the coupe like a high speed and the helicopters come and realize theres nothing behind us, its behind me
Your honor, I fuck over these beats with no condom
This aint really a rap, its a porno, rewind it back
Its back to defining a loss, correct, they dont obey
Yall aint nice nigga, yall just okay
Yall more than a Lil Jon phrase
Im Mike Jordan in his prime, a modern day Issac Hayes
Fingers on the shaft, new to the theme song of your career
Study my craft, you ignorant?, I can do it without a pen and a pad
Its inspiration, something yall have never had
If my pockets is something youre trying to grab, see I pull out a rocket and peel you back like scab, you old news
Old dudes get out my way let the young boy come through, dont mention my age, SHIT
Im on a mission for pay and you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like youre here
But actually you aint accurate fucking with this music biz
The industry like Fuck it, let the music be his
No theme park, Im not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, Jaws is here jump in the water
Do we really fuck with president Carter?
My reply is that I cant stay away from the bosses
Got the bidding war popping like an auction
Five or ten labels like What he hitting for?, seven zeros or more
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my door
Money in front of me I couldnt open the door
Im so far ahead of my time I got people 5 years from now pressing rewind
Im hardly impressed with yall, I hate rappers
Where the true artists at?, if it aint a good picture you draw dont bring it to the architect
Often yall arguing bout who got next
Claiming yall running the game niggas is barely walking yet
Hopping all over beats without going through training camp
Try studying a few greats and then maybe youll be where Im at
Your songwriting aint great, your mixtape is mediocre
You recycle the same quotes, youre not
Switching your flow, your flow in the same place
Dont just rap elaborate, expand, try to be more creative perhaps
My rap friends, I aint saying that you whack, psych
Like an invoice Im just stating the facts, right?
The metaphors I write
In fact youve been a factor youve feared your whole life, no TV show
Dont compare me with them, thats like Jaws vs. Nemo
A gorilla to a chimp, Jordan vs. Kukoc
A Tony Montana with blow in his nose to a Nino
I aint no joke I used to let the mic smoke
Now Im like Mike Jordan with the flow
Identify with a scientific scope
Scope over the rifle
Fragments and potholes
Got rappers selling surveillance behind black tint in the parking lot at Roscoes
Making the change lift straight jack move
Pack 2 some mechanic
Pull it out you panic, flow nuts like cashews
Shift to Cancun, even though I’m Compton
Like Raider Caps and Corduroy house shoes
I be the illest witness the lyrical drug dealin’
When I distribute the word these rappers get hard feelings
No remorse sucka MC’s throw fits cause I carry the torch without Olympics
Kill all friendships my enemies
Go against the God MC? penalty crucifixion
So nice wish you had 3 ear drums to listen
Damn right I be the don Corleone of rap songs whether on the east cost or back home
We clap chrome like magnetic monkey wrenches
Used to hop fences
Now we hop on top of bad bitches pass em to the homies like basketball assists
West Coast Vengeance, East Coast Revenue something new like
Pac in Versace lenses Big in the Khaki Suit
Best of both worlds when I step in the booth
Suicidal thugs from them him her and you
I kick away the chair you hang from the noose
Shoutout to sidegun and Papoose, Kunta Kinte and ?
Bringing it back to the roots, you understand
Yeah yeah yeah from Cali to N.Y
You already know lets get it in
Like Mike Tyson in his prime, knocking out rappers with every line
Wont attest how I come back with a forty-five
Like MJ, sucker MC’s expire
LA Nigga not to be fucked with, Thug Quick
Guns tucked nigga we buck shit
We do pop take off your rooftop
On the rooftop with choppas infrared dot ya
One shot no doctors, just yellow tape and white sheets
Buck chrome tell em why
Living like felipe though you lay on our paper
Yo life we repo play for keeps, no need for peace talk
Catch contact whenever the weed spark
Yeah its chronic in whatever we smoke
Got signed but I’m still in the hood like a brick of blow
Hit the club made my pick n’ roll this should give em dough
Jay Rock used to be in them drug spots
Now I rap for the dough all for the Mula, hoo-ha
Sucker MC’s no threat, i could run laps around each one no sweat
They’d all be scared of me, no one ahead of me
Nailed to the throne, I’m a project celebrity
These niggas ain’t all that they said they’d be
Nothing but images raping the youth stealing their benjamins
Under the dirt is where we sending them
New coupe speed off color be cinnamon
Nike Cortez’s, and Pendletons
LA style hop out slide doors on a minivan
Its like that spray the whole block if we miss one spot, what we gotta do
Come right back
I play the passenger
Dumb shot then pour gas on ya
Acting like Nelson as I laugh at ya
The young boy Casper ya
Ya soul rise out the casket bruh
New rap game lazarus, Top Dawg ENT Soliders ain’t nothing after us
They say that Im the one
And you, you are the prototype
You might have the ears of sound
But you already know who they like
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody to hold you real tight
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody tell em hes the prototype
I am the truth, no lie about it
Bring my testimony when I walk in that booth
Walking the thin line between love and hate, I defend mines
Join them when it comes to their crunch time, I never fold
I love pressure, thats why I apply so much on niggas thinking they better
I am a clutch shooter, I am a sharp shooter
And its great enough to hear the butterfly moving
Follow me moving through these ghetto streets and school I say fuck retarded sweep
Walk into school the chief right there tried to talk at me
In the midst of Piru and natty Blood beef
Shall we hesitate or walk down 
That 10-grade summer we had death right in front of us
Then leave the house without kissing our mamas
The new Jordans came out, but we didnt get them
Cuz the color haunt them to get too much attention
Damn it I liked it thoughs
Pac was talking bout the concrete rose
I never seen one till I looked in the mirror
There go, huh huh, thats the flow right there
You should use it, thats what my conscience said then I hopefully abused it, huh
I am the lyrics and the music, yall rapping note for the beat
I let the instrumentals listen to me
I listen to heat, my ears can hear fire
I pierce through the flame like barbed wire breaking up concrete
And I aint thinking bout no rap beef
Niggas is getting killed throughout the week, thats every day
Catchin bullets like an umpire
We tried to stay home but still aint safe
Thats baseball tactics, retaliation back and forth like tennis rackets, we used to it
Who can circle round the block the fasters
If you can do it, think you know why it becomes a practice
We worked it out like barely total
Cuz shit happens
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody to hold you real tight
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody tell em hes the prototype
I aint even rap but let them young boys get ya
Paint a perfect picture like Im rhyming only scripture
Im nice, ice water veins, its pure no filter
Who you get your style from, the same real familiar like I heard it before
But reincarnation is a blind man spirit
So I aint going for it, na uh
I aint having it, you getting to board it
Like an unfair mother, my child you gon suffer
To you acknowledge to whom gave you life to knowledge in Zion learning and taking deuce through college
The prototype for the flows you like
Im surgical Ronald Mike, I cut you up somethin nice
Get out the pocket, Im sending them skyrockets right through your minds
Optic popping out your eye sockets, ah
Excites a riot every time Im rhyming
In accordance with the snare I got impeccable time, Junior
They say that Im the one
And you, you are the prototype
You might have the ears of sound
But you already know who they like
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody to hold you real tight
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody tell em hes the prototype
Im wakin up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
Im breathin in the chemicals
Im breaking in, shaping up, checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
YA! YA! YA! YA!
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know! Where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
Brace yourself, Ill take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how Im slingin crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan
YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin yo hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans
Hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where beep hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin for if you aint walkin up, you fuckin punk?
Pickin up the fuckin pump, pickin off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin from
AKs, ARs, Ayy, yall, duck!
Thats what Momma said when we was eatin the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in 94, fuck yo truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Aint no peace treaty, just pieces BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure youre corporate or theyll be callin your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit aint no threat
You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
Lets get It!
Man down, where you from, nigga?
I said, where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
If Pirus and Crips all got along
Theyd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time Im in the street, I say—
YA! YA! YA! YA!
Im wakin up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa, Im radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, Im radioactive, radioactive
All systems go
The sun it hasnt died
Deep in my bones
Straight from inside
Bury me alive, bury me with pride
Bury me with berries, that forbidden fruit and cherry wine
Thank you berry much, but tonights my night and Im Barry Bonds
Swingin for the fences, barbaric Kendrick in idle time
Everything in lifes subject to change, change whip, change grind
Change clothes, change opinions, right before I change my mind
I dont really know yah business, been in there since I was bendin Lego blocks
Now you tell the world about me, dry snitch
Tater tots on my shotgun, I gotta pop one at the stars
Skys the limit, I gotta finish as the first rapper on Mars
Mark my word, Ima make my mark, when they start their Martial Law
When these Martians alienate, my mental state is still at heart
Lord, look in my eyes, tell me I died, tell me I tried, to compromise
Tell me you love me, tell me that I, dont really care and can barely decide
Wishin good luck on my enemies, energy go to the almighty God
Drown in a bottle of Hennessy, with no amenities
Im gettin better with time
Aaah!
Im wakin up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa, Im radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, Im radioactive, radioactive
Can you feel me with time, can you feel me
Can you feel me with time, can you
Hey
Can you feel me with time
Oh
Can you feel me with time, can you
Can you feel me with time, can you feel me
Can you feel me with time
Radioactive, radioactive

Intelligent thug, half of the time Im Nasir Jones
Cooking live at the barbecue
When I reveal poems from the composition
Destroy the competition
Never on the wire
But look Joe, heres the proposition
I pray for you fools every day like a faithful christian
Sunk my soul in white wood the whole eighth Im twistin
Cutlass, jet black 78 edition
Im a genius, straight As when I ride the rhythm
Cut the pie more than twice and Im gon get a slice
Dont act like I aint the truth
Word to Proof, lets go get em Ninth
Uh-Uh, lets go get em Ninth
Middle East represent lets go get em Ninth
Im sad cause my generation got the blindest eyes
Niggas rapping bout drugs like its saving lives
Investing time into these hoes like potential wives
If thats the mother of yo son boy dont be surprised
Didnt think that karma was real
The condom flushed down your toilet resurrected as a beautiful kid
Got you working double time to lead that cubicle shit
Make up your mind, holy design or Lucifers tips
Yeah I know lifes complicated
Open the bottle just to see its all concentrated
Pulp fiction I will never pump fiction just to leave pots pissed in
Spittin at the camera like Pac before prison huh
You know the losers say it happens to the best of us
The best of who dawg? Who are you dawg?
Im U-turning in the clouds because of me
Been logging off since that guy on Youtube is me
Usually I would like attention
But strangers get stranger with every Can I get a picture?
Im trynna tell folks blog posts dont make ya richer
But thank you for supporting all the genius in a nigga
Tread water on flat land
My larynx hold crack cocaine for a rap fan
Looking for more than the shuckin and jivin of rappers compromisin they taste
Like eating off a griddle no blow
Never congregate with the so-so
Snob hop in its purest, this here is my modern life
I took a vow, never live moderate
That was way back when I was on Ivy league college shit
They wont let me live it down so I live it up
I used to want my citys crown now it isnt much
No shots fired when Pac died
Back when it wasnt cooler to be lying to the consumer
Matata Hakuna, I am the Lion King
Tell these hoes what they want, Im the Lyin King
Word to McLuda, Brainiac
No blanks in my six shooter, they all hollow
Take a tip, out the sip
Class is dismissed
Yo, coming straight up from Chicago
They say Im coming from the outside looking in
Looking like that nigga that your favorite rapper shouldve been
Better than the best right, catch me in the next life
Bet Im still spittin uglier than Ushers ex-wife
Add-2 a problem in the column Ann Landers writes
So mean but on the mic Im near Planters nice
A genius like Jean and Ninth and kill tracks
Trynna hurry up before Drake and J. Cole bring light-skinned back
You kick it like hacky sack, I aint going back to that
For every scar on Seal’s face, I can spit a rap to match
They nervous like a suburban jumping the curb
And the shit I spit is stuck on they mind like hodgy wearing his turban
I was told to go harder, and try and touch the dollar
Mo dots be on they ass than Laurence Fishburne daughter
Artists hard as the hardest part the part a gotta martyr us
And Martin must
Guess Ill dumb it down we all smarten up
If you look inside my mind youll probably see atomic bombs
Loaded with explosive grenades holding dope rhymes
And its potent
You never heard a heroic flow more divine
As a poet I know Im the don
Like sunrise and I owe it to family genes
The Albert Einstein in the pocket of dungarees
And Im dunking on Shaq with ease
Its a lay up every time I stay up
Im in the studio the time they wake up, but wake up
It gets worse
Theres not a weapon that can prosper
The prognosis of a sick rapper that can rock ya whole roster
This is genius, can vouch in v-necks
Or catch a snow blizzard if Kendrick gon visit
Im that cold with it, you know me
My intellect get intertwined with God
Get washed up like a tide if you dont pay your tithes
Oceans divide whenever I speak
Cars will collide when Im on this beat
Wreck shit for the record once the record peak
Brittany Street, yea, time told on itself
Kinda happy here to see this, I’m a actual genius
Ninth, I’m on a pedestal lift a finger when it’s needed
A genius makes no mistakes
So it’s cool I had to wait push the bull to the side
And keep my power in the safe
Now I release it in this room
Even if you don’t believe you’ll catch a spirit in this place
I’m a actual revolver
When it comes back around hope it’s me for the take
I’m a thief for this space, I want it all or nothing
It’s never beef for this cake
And I’m the beauty and the beast and on this beat I will shake
Damn slow down Street, naw nigga this my pace
You need actual proof, I’m the actual stakes
Past the around and tell them super genius on it’s way
Brittany Street
What a beautiful day it is, cruisin’ to Mayfield
In a ride that glide like when he was hoopin’ in 
Living proof for the ‘mazing is
Scooped up your broad now my palm on the cranium
Gettin’ dome, indoor stadium
Rocky ass roll when I’m all in your 
You must suck at life, I’m on the cusp of hypes
Unattainable to most, safe to say I’ve touched the sky
Delante West you muthafuckin’ 
Show some respect for the toughest on the mic
Daytona, paint images like Iliad from Homer
What you hearin’ is quotables
You never get it if you slow to move
Success smell sweet like when roses bloom
Defeat like sea salt in an open wound
I know some goons that keep the strap on like rented bowling shoes
 those them dudes I keep close for hoes like you
No lenience for idiots, my five thoughts beyond smart
He’s a muthafuckin’ genius
Yo they mocking me when they should be copying their Laws
Knowledge is forever but novelty wears off
Like names on a wall, and fade like hairlines
They gave mine airtime
This is for the Judas that call me Jesus in person then say he’s just OK
He jock my colour quality painted my genius gray
So I’mma meet the chicks he want and steadily strong arm ‘em
Make ‘em glow like silver and readily Long John ‘em
It’s not a problem, or one that I can’t solve
They wanna stop to talk shit man but I can’t stall
In this modern warfare they say that I can’t but I can’t recall
Poppin’ off with my back to the wall
Is being a genius being a capital G
In this day avoiding it after seeing it
Either it’s something that you can’t reach
Or it’s something that your whack mentors can’t teach
Genius
Knowledge connoisseur, genius provocateur
The genius schizophrenic, scribble my mental image
Replace the inkblots, graph a genius plot
Off the charts I mark my territory
Glory been 
Banner in the lab before the gamma radiation got to damage him
You bore me, what of Arabia? Pen prick
Dot my I’s, got my eyes fixed on Angelou’s prize
Bleed ink never cry, logic on the fly
I promised I would try to bring more
To make your lightbulbs fry
Shy of autism, walk with him he’s Rainman, huh
Talk with him just to figure out the game plan, ha, game theory
Marvel my brain picking pieces of a sane man
I make it rain again
Beautiful mind of intuitive design
By omega in the skies
And we don’t brainstorm, just cause you will waste it
We make it drizzle just a little go ahead and taste it
The brainiac has made it, a makeshift
Modern day genius, Act Proof that crazy shit
Dustin Hoffman, on again, off again
 and I’m lost again
I am E, I do it seamless
Freakin’ this genius
Yup a G I is, but lethal we see y’all niggs
Straighten you out, you see my lens
Freakin’ this re-a-mix up a little 
I’ll find out whoever the comp is
I promise them 
They will see I’m kind of a monster
 my harmonica
Honest, I’m one of the smartest, like I’m from Boston
MIT-in’ it
Meet the illest team I’m with, more in tune like most improved to a 
Shit, clean cut, read a few books to get up my bucks
Give ‘em a mean look, believe it they seem shook, they stuck
Niggas get steam cooked when I read books
Roastin’ cats when provoked, and peep the Opus
One of the dopest, get to know us, 
And show it whenever class is in session
Know it, get out your notes
This genius shit? I wrote it, let’s go
Tonights the night I jump on my shh... uh huh?
Lyrical mayhem, rappers get laid down when I kick
 K rounds, a transformer how I break down
Nouns and verbs, you just stumble over your words
So in love with my shit they save it in pampers
The only pull ups be the drive by when I pull up then pull out
Whatever you did shout I put up
Then take the residuals after leaving your body in critical
Fuck em all though, more drive than a car show
Four five in the console, call me Soul Eastwood
Lyrical gun slanging’ and a corral full of wild niggas
PC shut down niggas, its P.E. I run around niggas
You shawn pope you just sound bigger
You bad boys bite the brick like snitches bite bullets
No diss to Diddy, thats just how I like to put it
Living’ life crooked like a neck muscle after you pull it
187, look at the footage
Like O-Dawg, and oh you Oh Dog, you either pay up
Or have your daughter makin’ that ransom phone call
Player, I don’t tolerate niggas who fabricate stories
Who says you did what 
I’m sounding like Noreaga for the paper
One leg to erase ya, kinda ironic
Calling the shots like Chick Hearn in intern
Your chick hair fall in my crotch, follow me pop
Spit champagne, they should bottle me up
We on the edge like when my barber be lining me up
Never pledge allegiance, my mom mustve done bred a demon
My pop mustve done shot bullets instead a semen
I led a legion of doom cramped up in the womb
And started teething the day I heard a beat, lets eat
Yeah, Top Dawg E-N-T
And its 187 on a muthafuckin beat
Yeah, Top Dawg E-N-T
And its 187 on a muthafuckin beat
Yeah, Top Dawg E-N-T
And its 187 on a muthafuckin beat
Yeah, Jay Rock, Watts ambassador
Big truck, paint color Almond Joy
Black choppers seem like the commodores
Get money, fuck bitches, do it like a chore
Thats the routine, 24 hours
More money, more power, fuck problems
Pop my collar, hit clubs and pop bottles
For the dollars I’m Master P, Bout It, Bout It
Take a look at my wrist
Now look at my 
It feels like I have a fuckin’ jukebox on
You niggas ain’t hot, you niggas lukewarm
And I had swag ever since I was born
And every car I drive, yes it must be foreign
So when I ride by your bitch yelling popcorn
I get up under your skin, yes I’m a fuckin thorn
And they have a stash spot and you just been warned, bitch
Game said it first, I’m the next out the west
Want a test? Knock your spirit up out your flesh
Who’s the best rapper, I’m his favorite rapper
Too Fresh like a nigga still in the wrapper
I’m the shit like a nigga still in a pamper
Hit a booth, kill a track then we light candles
187 everytime I spit a scripture
Jay Rock, Watt City, I’m the perfect picture
You ain’t gotta worry about who’s hotter
I been poppin’ collars
Been making it rain in the club, I been about my dollars
I can’t seen colors, I’m colorblind
So when you hit me up, all you gon see is fuckin dollar signs
Got my motivation, my nigga stay on the grind
Even if its back on the block pushing nickels and dimes
Addicted to crime, I fuck with known felons
Top Dawg E-N-T, thats what they yelling, nigga
The only way Ive been practicing my whole life is to be responsible for what I do. I dont know how to be responsible for what every black male did. I dont know. Yes I am gonna say that Im a thug, thats because I came from the gutter and Im still here
Im a mothafuckin thug, I hate payin taxes
Just hate it, Im tryna fuck a couple actresses
If I dont got it Ima make it
Still dont got it, Ima take it
Run that shit, take your shit, thats what I wont do
Out here doin what I want to
Nigga you do what you can
Thats the difference, Im a mothafuckin man
Im a man, nigga, and as a man I dont take dick
I dont do Versace, thats that gay shit
Yeah I said it, Im a thug
Im a thug, nigga, guess I need a mothafuckin hug
Well dig my mama up and tell her give me one
Lot of niggas say theyre real, Im the realest one
Im the realest, this exactly how Im feelin, bruh
Aint no chillin, bruh
Im a motherfuckin thug
Im a motherfuckin thug
Im a motherfuckin thug
Im a motherfuckin thug
Im a motherfuckin thug
Im a thug, the conditions Im living
Its got me condition for prison, the condition for killing
The condition that we put kids in, often poverty stricken
And even theyre education becomes a pipeline to prison
Simply a tool used for mass incarceration
Call it the new plantation, call it new era slavery
Call the court system racist, call it just what it is
A plot and plan for paper that punish the poorest kids
OReilly, Hannity, Limbaugh, Geraldo know what it is
But they be on that fuck boy shit, blaming your kids
Don Lemon too, Wolf Blitzer three
I often wish I can have a sit down with every C and every B
And help them see we not enemies
And that includes fraternities with their college degree
Im part drug kingpin mixed with Booker T
Im whatever Blacks need me to be
Sometimes I look in the mirror and ask myself what Im scared of
How dare the media portray me this way, I can hear the
Crowd screaming, the weirdest of chants, they all in my ear-a
All thats an error, role model I cant
Its like Im a parrot, apparently Im marking the dance
Ive seen done with the devil, such a ghetto romance
How many niggas fall victim, looking at you trapped in the system
Mentally they kept you in prison, and you wont get out, no one visit
Open up your mouth no one listen, you in denial, nigga
Im in denial with you, I dial dead homies numbers off this liquor
Time and time again I find myself inside the cerebellum
Of several felons, Orions belt couldnt live in my world
I seen tigers, lions let loose and spooked, Im next door to Earl
I guess I rely on Jesus to save us before I refer
The madness, my neighbors witness ski masks
The masses dont know Im packing this four and harassing your ho
Antagonizing the business you love the most
See the difference to my approach is a 40 ounce at the store
If a forty bounce to get low, I never learn, Im hard-headed
The corporate world dont like it, but I said it
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
God Orion lives in me
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
God Orion lives in me
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around
Yo, if you could see what I was thinking --
Youd probably see a boat floating in my quotes
Fluid like sewer drain, too insane --
Like everything Edgar Allan Poe wrote
Call the Olympics, I cant even spit it -- I pole-vault
And your teams like making love for the slowpokes
Here we go though -- Soul got a blunt rolled up
Chocolate Thai got me right, yeah I Cocoa Puff --
Time to time? Shit, Im high all day
Like the sun, you could catch me in the sky all day
Money like pre-algebra -- multiply all day
My style cayenne pepper so I spit like Dylan
Whenever the mic gone --
Got sick and tired of asking for shit to write on
Now the only pen that I grip --
Exists in my cerebral cortex
The future is like a quartet -- I fore-see it bitch
You know Id really hate to murder you rappers -- 
I wish I never heard of you rappers -- 
Shits whack man you need more practice -- 
So go practice --
Go practice
Shit -- my impact is flammable gaseous in a room full of lit matches
Rumor has it Im hazardous --
Rap Lazarus, the hip hop Jesus of Nazareth
Polaroid couldnt capture this
Im candidating like an activist, back to this
Im profound, you niggas lost like Angeles
Im fierce like a wildebeest --
Built like a million-piece puzzle
Put together by hustle, who wanna scuffle?
We laugh to the bank and you chuckle -- keep the change
My genetic makeups too different to be the same as yall
Like sending instant messages when I aim at yall --
Im hitting you up
Like graffiti on the wall, hope you get what you ask for
As for Ab-Soul, Im a asshole -- thats all
Shut them down like Ctrl - Alt - Delete, capisce?
Mind-boggling, word gargling word-ologist
What you hollerin?
I got enough spit to form my very own island, my friend
Wanna take a swim?
Step into the booth, youll probably need a bathing suit
Skinny-dipping, my thoughts inside a pool of sharks do
You hesitate to test the waters of a fish tank
You first-timer -- You need more than one-liners
Your color scheme is undone, all you have is the primer
Paint pictures like art designers --
Architect when I often draw the tech
Then put your carcass over your set when the words eject
Celibacy flow --
Really dont matter the sex, just letting you know --
Women could get it quicker like chlamydia nigga
Disease-infested, please consider --
The piece of her comprehension inside my jurisdiction
And you cant deliver
If you could see my thoughts I recollect in the booth --
Self genocide rhyme, hang yourself from the noose --
To spit iodine from a spectators view
Punch is off his rocker, locked in Davy Jones locker
Un-controllable urge to splurge on the verse
Baptize them with the words, shall return as the first
Born immaculate birth, dog, cuz what Im worth --
Is the earths first garden and thats only when Im starvin nigga
Yeah...Ima stop right there
K-Dot, Ab-Soul, Punch
Murder you rappers
Damn, love or lust
Damn, all of us
Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
So give me a run for my money
Sippin bubbly, feelin lovely, livin lovely

Just love me, just love me, just love me
Love me

Keep it for real, without you equals nothin’

But baby don’t worry, I’m here to take care of you
I’m here to make you smile something that nigga couldn’t do
It kinda been awhile, that a nigga had impress you
There’s a lot of girls in this crowd, but you’re the only one I find special
My bars are here to address you
Baby you’re a star, don’t ever let a nigga stress you
Let’s get in the car, cause that’s the only way I can confess to you
Get to know you more while drivin’ cause later on tonight I’m tryna undress you
Open your car door, to show that I was raise right
Cause I know that’s gonna impress you
Baby, don’t think I’m here to play you
I’m actually here to stay with you
Pussy or not I can’t stay away from you
If my mind wasn’t this fucked up, would you still ?
If I went out and commit a crime, would you still ?
Keep it real, Id rather have you trust me than to 
Keep it for real, without you equals nothin’
Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
So give me a run for my money
Sippin bubbly, feelin lovely, livin lovely
Just love me
Just love me, just love me, just love me
Love me

Okay
I’m on the way
We ain’t got time to waste
Listen to the words i’ma say
That kitty I’m tryna taste
I do this shit everyday
You’re someone I ain’t scared to chase
She made me smile today, when I saw her pretty ass face
At the end of the day, my life was in a better place
She kinda blush today, when I had my hands around her waist
Yeah, I’m the kid with the “nigga naps” but also with the sweetest raps
Bars like Coles, attitude like Kenny
Lord I know, you’re always be with me
I got goals, so baby don’t be scared to achieve them with me
We all know, who’s really ridin’ with me
I wanna have somethin’ real, like Bobby and Whitney
I’m being for real, I feel that you’re the only one that gets me
If my mind wasn’t this fucked up, would you still ?
If I went out and commit a crime, would you still ?
Keep it real, Id rather have you trust me than to 
Keep it for real, without you equals nothin’
Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
So give me a run for my money
Sippin bubbly, feelin lovely, livin lovely
Just love me
Just love me, just love me, just love me
Love me
Love me, just love me

I kick a funky friendly conversation that keep they mind racin
You cant complain about the flow I got
I let my thoughts space out with the astronauts
Like the white boys say, Pass the pot
Let me smoke for a minute...
As god as my witness, I never abuse this hip hop
Ill never pretend to be something Im not
Giving you something to rock to other than hardcore rap, possible
You ever been under hypnosis I mean literally
Not being focused with your eyes open
They say 90% of humans dont even notice
Now can you imagine a couple of minutes passing without you knowing what happened
Without you knowing people was laughing at you
They say the worse scenario is when they have to catch you
You wake up out of your mind, your whole thoughts is baffled
Youre doing things like trying to touch your shadow
Now heres some realistic, is it something that can happen or is it just a gimmick
You never know until your bear witness
Bear witness...
Bear witness...
You woke up in the morning, took a shower
Call some bitches over, want them to be over in one hour
She came over, you fucked
She left and you hopped in the truck, you
Took your shirt off cause outside was burning up, you
Skirted off turned your beat up but your gun was tucked
Under the seat, you headed to Long Beach
Hop on the 710 the carpool lane
Only cause you got black tint and they cant see a thing
Your check engine light popped up, its feeling like bad luck or what not
You tried to maneuver all the way to the call box
But one lane before you got there your car stopped
Stop
If your was listening for the past two minutes
Then you just made accurate 90% hypnosis
Aw, this is four jiggling balls in your mouth all day everyday
Ay you tuned into a fuck what you hear radio where you can stick a dick in your ear and um
 Aw shut the fuck up bitch but anyway
We got this new K Dot record I know you a trap where you at baby
Down Rosecrans
87 regal sipping on a gold can
Gun tucked like the fetal, position
Top Dawg coalition coexisting with the coldest you ever quoted from California district
Been a coroner like David Banner Im the owner
Of the marijuana aroma youre smelling hear the donor yelling its me bitches
Who did it, I did it, take em where they cant go
Like planet Venus leaning like a mad scientist
Laboratory bottles of empty Heineken telling stories about the ones that came before me
China-man squinting his eyes because Im blinding him, my shine is
Bigger than a strike of lightning they liking him because I like to win
Never lose, put me on a pedestal
Bet I pedal victories until I pedal off my shoes
Welcome to the lions room, challenge anybody whom
Wanna try they luck they get fucked up and all you heard was 
Say hello to the little big homie, and your reality aint realer than this homie
Now with my hopes in the back
I could ride like this, or like that
Putting all the bullshit aside
K Dot be too funkified
Tell him hes too cool, bitches
Holla what it do, bitches

They be crackin like a pack of sunflowers seeds
That the devil tree, put my dick on your double D, double Ds
I learnt that from the dog pound, dont get mad at me
Im just a product of what was happening in the nineties
Plus my uncle used to fuck with your auntie
Tell me 80 percent ho run in your family
Shame on you, shame on your mother, sister, cousin too
You all produced the same tendencies
While I continue to stack plentl cheese
On my expedition to witness my own odyssey
Out of three, of your favorite bet I give them more flavor like seasoning salt
Call me the Darth Vader invading a raw plot like a space crew, stayed at home
All the gangbangers with the police radars like the Marcus rustle but I hustle
Never change up see my muscle, training like Im constipated bringing in any drama
If you insist, Im six for six
Get your ass rolled and twisted, like a blunt rap so fall back
Like winter ended
Its like that 
Like that 
Like that 
C.O.M.P.T.O.N, thats the city that I live in
I got more drank bitch, bring more friends
Bitch bring more friends
I said C.O.M.P.T.O.N, thats the city that Im repping

Whats cracking bounce, skate, rock, roll, hello, world, here we go
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta

Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
When I kick it, I kick it as if the beat was my enemy
You have thought it was ten of me, on point like a widow peak
I deliberately give em dillies that do what it do
Painting a picture like doodling, dude you aint shit but doo-doo
In the city where the semis get pointed at him, them and you
You can hide, you get, if you want to, I do karate moves
But the crouching tiger just might get broken down by a writer
Yeah the passenger hopped out, but you got shot by the driver
Theres a killer like everywhere, so why would you take it there
Neighborhood terrorist got the terror when this people scared
Thats why my intelligence tell me to keep a banger
Tell me fuck you Ill tell you fuck you back with my index finger
I can flip on some killershit but Id rather keep cool
Keep it so remind it try not to be a pussy like you
Nigga that Cali cold attack, Cali on my back till my torso break

Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta

Make em close the stitches, Hells Kitchen, Im throwing dishes
This is spoken wisdom as I journey a poets mission
Im up lifting, my flow is gifted
Should come with a bow of ribbons
Road to riches, load the biscuits lets go the distance
Im blow and listen my car how why you with a broke ignition
They so suspicious, low and vicious with no convictions
Juries making their own decisions they want us to go to prison
Cold adrenaline I got this soul like a poets living
So is spitting its like Im co-existent to prohibition
Im a dressin critics who say these widows the best as spit it
Disrespect the spirit, or the artist who rap with lyrics
Mother-F statistics they rap with metaphysics
And they yeah simplistic, they stay out as repetition
Show some recognition
Heard your album my best of missed it

Papoose is the definition
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta

Yeah... if you dont know my name by now
Just call me any rapper, could get it
Any month, any week, any day, any minute
Im knocking ballers off of their pivot in this scrimmage
They painting pictures with no description
Like a witness, who took an oath of no snitching
Mind ya business, like the best entrepreneur, I be diminished
By the metaphor, in the following sentence
I told you I does it a dozen times, you must of thought I was lyin
Yeah Im nice but Im not too kind
So dope I can say the same line two times
So dope I can say the same line two times
I dont care about your age, your creed, or color
The squares in your circle or the angles you covered
If you in front of your girl, your cousin or mother
I spread your ass out in the street like butter
You got your toast, well Im on a quip with a quote
So a bullet leaving your chambers like a word that I spoke
Soul brother number dos, Im a breathe in hundreds smoke
Driven down central by a nigga in some Locs
Never going back to Cali cause the nigga never leave
Even when Im out the state, you see me, you see L.A
And aint nobody fucking with me, like a virgin with Klamydia

Proud but still in my pradas, ya bitch

West coast till my death bed, cutting up
Somebody fucking with Mr. Edward Scissorhands
Ive been the man before youve been the man
And Ive been the mans equilibrium until its worrisome
Aiming for his gut like Caesarians
Throw me in aquariums, I bet Ill grab a shark
Snatch out his heart, freeze it then preserve it in a jar
Im all these niggas bumping like stickers at the end of a car
Aka K Dot commit a sin, press record

This a crime, you rehearse, or duck the bomb
Big ass W, and I throw it up like powder in the hands of Lebron, nigga what?
Compton on my raider cap, oh wait, no wait
But we want our spot back, then go nuts
Somebody hand me their jockstrap, I ball everywhere

Royal flush, like the feds rolling up
And I fuck with Bad Lucc but never broke a mirror

My wheels peel, like its Motrin

Waters run deep, and you fucking around with scuba
Divers with riders sticking their hand inside the cooler

Bout to run the game in some ran down Pumas
And my name Mr. K Almighty, try to low ball
But she speaks only highly, try me, Q
Lets see how many do it
Put your hands up now, lets see how many truant
Lying to the people, know you want for your doings
Good with this rap talk, Im kinda speaking fluent
Influenced by cocaine, gats, and my dickies
Life in the 50s, swisher sweet wrapped in a sticky
Malt liquor stuffed up in paper bags, got me sparked up
First nigga act up, he getting choked up
Locced up, only seeing .45 from the jeans
You see a nigga work from the spleen, you naw mean?

Classic Timeless rules forever
By the time I start writing when I was thirteen I knew from the jump I wanted something that was original that was classic
I freestyle over anything give me a instrumental
I bet I make bells ring
I bet I make birds sing
It sounds that good
Im so street and Im so hood
And Im intelligent and Im special and Im heaven sent
Haha
When you think about rhymes and style you always want a classic feel so my first introduction to a classic shoe was the moment I stepped in school and said, I want to put something down on paper. I started writing. Everyone in the classroom was wearing Reebok classics
Hip-hop was more than just the music. It was part of culture. It was part of havin style it was part of a whole graffiti and arts
Hot off the press
Hot off success
Look how I dress free, me
Reebok complete

Diggy Doc, this one is for you
I remember when it all started
On Alondra, in that small apartment
Burgundy carpet and SEGA cartridges
Pop a flick and blunt ashes all on the garments
Momma of off wine cooler, Magic Johnson played Jordan
I was only four, but its like I heard it before
A house party cracking off of the music the Dr. recorded
And according to my awareness I was more than coherent
A cold listener, mocking that shit like a parrot
My cousins kicking up dust Cripping
They flag, wear it round their hand like a mitton
Aiming, use it for leverage
Shitting on Compton sheriffs like Fuck the Police
Woofers and gold Rollies
Every swap meet should know me
Cause I copped every record that dropped
Dropped a dub just to hear Doc drop
A jewel for the sake of hip-hop
Who ever have thought the moment I seen you on Bullis for Cali love
Fifteen years later youd be saving my life, what
Reminiscing on when we used to smoke chronic

Fuck your heritage, fuck your brainwash detergent
Internet urgent, time travel in purges, every man and virgin
Fuck chatterin sermons
Fuck your church propaganda, only God know the answer

Camouflage like a sheep, so we slide through the cancer
Lies and deceit, vibe like a Phantom
Dodgin police and paramedic retreats

Oh my God man, oh my God
We bout to shit on these faggots man
Check it
Yeah, K. Dot
First niggas used to rapping, get my attention
Now I dont even listen
It run through one ear and out the other
And I dont buy niggas records for music
Im more interested in their album covers
Im a talented brotha
Plus I move so quick its like my brain came with a joystick
Motherfuckers better listen when I spit
I knock records out the park
Homeboy I Ken Griffey a hitch
And I might Ken Griffey ya bitch
But wont buy her shit, not even a small bag of chips
Just give her long pipe til its scrapin her hips
Like a waitress, the way the broad ask for the tip
If you want, just ask for a clip
Ill give ya those for free, no, I wont charge a fee
Just roll up on you, like cut off sleeves
Nobody can cut off the number one rap artist, damn, I am the hardest
Blowin through Nintendo cartridges
To Maybachin it, valet parkin it
Now people arguin who is better?
Them or him, him referring to me
Them referring to the industry
Hands down, Jay left, now give me the crown
Fuck later, Im takin it now
Fuck haters, Im takin em down
With the red beam, red beam, silencer, dont holler it muffle the sound
Bark like ten rottweilers straight from the pound
Straight for the dollas, 745, older Impala, scrapin the ground
I suggest you follow, or not be smarter
Seein another broke tomorrow
You can tell the way I speak begins to stutter
First it was hard for yall to even makin it harder
Aint about money, then please dont bother
Yall niggas funny, talkin bout that you run shit
When Im lookin at ya like Who are ya?
Yall niggas is gas
And what make that bad is yall niggas is trash
Yall dont wanna see me spaz
Out, pull the gats out and see me blast, ouch
You better off coppin a pen and a pad
Than copyin the last rhymes I had
And spit em to your homeboys till they all say You wrote that?
Tell em lies or, give em the facts
It dont matter cause in a minute, Ima be chargin my raps
A G for a bar, thats 3 16s, plus a 8 bar hook nigga, add up that
I charge you a verse like Dre would charge you a track
Your whole budget, hoes love it
But you hate it, cause Im your girls favorite
Nigga, face it, you cant walk in my shoes nor change the sides tryna replace it
As far as rap, I spit in the Matrix
Past reality, nigga actually, I wrote a rhyme where there was no gravity
Thats a whole nother planet
For real holmes, I do damage
Blow up ya city, even ya school campus
Run in ya class while your doin ya standards
Let it blast
One gun subtractin ya life, now thats the basics of math
Oh my God man let me stop spazzin out on these niggas, B
They have to call 911, Im done
Dave, you feel me man? Its real
K. Dot man, just havin a lil fun up here man
Its real ugly, ya know?
Yeah, bang, bang, lets go
Yeah...
Hit the East Side of the LBC
On a mission trynna find Mr. Warren G
When I jumped off the porch, I was forced into last resort
Of a typical short end, of course where that took us course
Hoarse for yelling out Demons that fought inside of me, talk society how to rejoice
Killers aside of me, privacy obviously was lost
Fraud, Piracy of the streets of my Odyssey
Caught a bullet that probably destroyed
A good kid in a mad city slightly annoyed
I walk out the street with no heat and wanted to beef when im just a vegan
Reeking the scent of a saint, sinner smelling the stars squeezing
Pillars stumbling straight to my melon apparent reason
Probably because im a cousin, cousin of blood that blooded in public
And Kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin
But you aint no friend of me, instead of Kendrick im Kennedy
Assassinate my character, sure, if thats your remedy
Fair enough, i got enemies, but guess who bang?
But thats the repercussion like when your cousin is cussing a blood and your by yourself at the Compton parade
Good kid, mad city, life or death, is you with me?
I hold my liquor
But this man can’t handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
Im on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now
I cant handle no liquor
And these bitches cant handle me
I cant control my bitches
And my bitches they cant control me
You say you know me, my witches
But you really just know the old me
Bitch, Im back out my coma
Wakin up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
Im hanging on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
Baby girl, hes a loner
Baby girl, hes a loner
Late-night organ donor
After that, he disown ya
After that hes just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
When its over its over
Bitch, Im back out my coma
That pussy got a spell on me
That pussy got a spell on me
That pussy got a spell on me
That pussy got a spell on me
Hey lil pretty lil, pretty lil, bish you
Walk around with these
Make
That pussy got a spell on me
That pussy got a spell on me
That pussy got a spell on me
That pussy got a spell on me
Gather round, Im glad everybody came out tonight as we stand on our neighborhood corner, know that this fire thats burning represents the passion you have, listen. Keisha, Tammy, come up front. I recognize all of you, every creed and color, with that being said fuck your ethnicity. You understand that? We gon talk about a lot of shit that concerns you. All of you
Now everybody, throw your hands up high
If you dont give a fuck, throw your hands up high
Now I dont give a fuck if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That dont mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga
Fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life
Yall be calling it hip-hop, I be calling it hypnotize
Yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body but freed my mind
What the fuck is you fighting for? Aint nobody gon win that war
My details be retail, man, I got so much in store
Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
Fuck that, nigga look at that line, its so diverse
They getting off work and they wanna see Kendrick
Everybody cant drive Benzs, and I been there, so it make it my business
To give em my full attention, ten-hut! Man, I gotta get my wind up
Man, gotta get down with God cause I got my sins up
Matter of fact, dont mistake me for no fucking rapper
They sit backstage and hide, behind the fucking cameras
I mosh pit, had a microphone and I tossed it
Had a brain, then I lost it, Im out of my mind, so dont
You mind how much the cost is, penny for my thoughts
Everybody, please hold up your wallets
Yeah man, Im the mailman, cant you tell, man?
Going postal, never freeze up, when I approach you
Thats star struck and roast you, oh my... HiiiPower
Im tired of yall, cause everybody lied to yall
And you believe it? Recognize them false achievements
Its treason and Im Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off
Knock on the doors of opportunity, Im too involved
Im no activist, Im no Einstein before calculus
I was kicking that Math, dropping that science
Like an alchemist, and I be kicking that ass, lyrically Im UFC
If a UFO had came for me, Imma come back with the head of an alien
Dont alienate, my dreams, get it right
Get a life, I got 2, thats a metaphor for the big shit I do
Boy, TMI, TSA, man Im fly, put wings on my back
That a plane or angel? Both like a pilot with a halo, whoa... Gross
I mean, Ive seen so many things come through them, him, her, you
Im just a messenger, yeah, I know lifes a bitch, get the best of her
Put them 3s up, they notice that we up, HiiiPower
And the power in the people and if they dont believe us, theyll die

Nothing but a g party like Pac in 96
But its 07 no half steppin’
Get outta line no mercy nigga we blast weapons
California economics got me hooked on it like phonics
When the beat drop I drop a bomb like atomic
Got my heat cocked like some type of bird
Big pimpin’ weapon under the fur
Limping’ like a prosthetic leg
But still play the back like bike pegs
La fitted cap pulling your wig back
With Glocks in it g roc black tinted
What side you claim fuck yo gang
Yeah Yeah thats what I’m talking bout nigga
I got more bars than singular
Keep a four five yeah seen me a

Nigga I’m a animal, raps new hannibal, king of my jungle, eat you like antelope
Product of the projects nigga I’m the shizznit
You don’t wanna test, give you lames the business
Watts California pay hell a visit, where a wrong turn can be your last visit
Pit Bulls on
Five in the morning I’m up cooking it up
Studio filled with coffee cups
I don’t sleep I just lay down and wink
I work like slavery was just last week
Somebody told me that every label
Got this button that beep and when I rap it go off
And thats when they know to push their album back
I don’t allow cats around the big dogs
You can’t see me, the force between us is thick fog
I never hang up when the money calls unless it be a emergency that my family involved
Don’t get your life involved, we’ll shoot without playing basketball, get your ass mopped
Like Lysol, you light MC, I’m heavy on the track
If you see my flow you would say its obese
Kdot/Lyrical Disease/Jay Rock
Americas Most Wanted

Harry Mack, visual raps, you gotta see
Uh, on New@2 and no one heard of me
Murder MCs, somebody throw a word at me

Stack em up real quick, take it to the bank
Harry Mack, every lyric is dank, rappers get spanked 
Yeah, one time, Ill bring em to the slaughter
Holler at the daughter, my flow is water

You know that I spit flows wiser
H-Mack, Im on it, you know Im bout to hold it
High off off of Jade cause we rolled it, I told it
One time, Harry Mack, the mic Im bout to slay it
He answered two out of three, so he aint have to pay it 
Ay, one time, Harry Mack, Im in the state of Zen
Rip again and again
Its off top, I need no pen
Yo, Im in, my zone when Im on it
I hit em like a missile
I wish I had the bracelet with the crystals
But Mack aint got money, right now I aint paid
Every rapper gettin slayed
Ima make his frame decayed
One time, ayo, I cut him like surgery
Somebody throw another word at me
Its absurd how I free 
Ay, one time, my lyrics is felt
Ill make you rappers melt
Bout to get the Cruz Show Belt
When Im all up on it, Harry Mack, you know that Im performing

Offa the top, Im cold flippin it
Yeah, ay, one time, you know I get it done
I remember watchin video for Heart Part I
My homie Brady B put me up on the game
When I watched the flow, I realized the shit was insane
After that, I saw Monster and I just knew
And before I really knew, then Kendrick had blew
Yo, good kid, m.A.A.d city I was bumpin the jam
Harry Mack, I cant believe Im sittin next to the man
Yeah, check it, when we do it, yo, the people have to give it up
Yo, we bout to take a couple shots up out the Dixie cup
Yeah, one time, I rest em with flames
Im sayin RIP Prodigy one of the best in the game
Its Harry Mack, yo
This is for my mothafucking Compton babies
And all the wild blocks that drove us crazy
Dominguez Hospital born
Niggas dying fast no life insurance
Black ski mask green leaf body bag liquor poured
So much 40 oz poured its like the curbs made of gold on the ave
Bullets got no names on it so if a girl get hit the response of it was like our bad
Thats the mind of state, rap niggas meet your fate
Say hello to the hip hops Norman Bates
I aint even burn em yet
Dave Chapelle these niggas are half baked
Well done when the second first come
I have an acquired taste
I will not let not one MC go to waste
I will eat all day
I will not, cannot lose, comfortable at the top
Im sittin down my legs are crossed like i had shoes
I tell dude, i aint worried about these rap dudes
Theyre not in my league, the West coast is me
Im, sub-zero, I put your career on freeze
I put it on Hov like I had ?
Im nightmare on Elm Street, come right through your dreams and
Delete you like an unwanted movie scene
Say hello to the team, aint ya?
Youre scared aint ya?
The world is anxious for my LP
Get pop grades, i get an A-plus, you get a D
Fucking failure!
So everybody put your shades on
Poobie came to show +Love+ like +Faizon+
Every bar that I carve is amaz-on
Wack niggas cant seem to feel our play on
A lil spice in my swag, call it Cajun
Often wonder to myself where the days gone
Save some, save none at the same time
Talk shit, take a stand in the same rhyme
Paid homage to the struggle thats before mine
Never bad-handing nothing, therefore I grind
Outshine most niggas, call em all suns/sons
Steady reaching for the stars, but its only one
Rapper, your favourite rapper, this is no +Pun+
+Big Daddy+, no +Kane+, get the job done
Im bout to stick the whole game up with no gun
And Imma show you how the South was won
So check it out
This is the part where we run Hip Hop
And we dont need props, we know we the shit
This is the part where we run Hip Hop
So get them hands high
Im yelling all my real niggas, keep moving
My real bitches, keep moving
I promise Ima keep moving
If they dont, we do it
The best 
I swear to give you nothing less, nothing less
Uh, yeah, hot damn, here we go again
Lyrical manslaughter off you and your mans
Im on the stage, you in the stands
Im on the road, you at the crib just scribbling
Your best sentence was doing your bid
Im through with you kids, like Brenda
I dont want to have to trash bin ya
When Ab enter, cats get they raps injured
Without no reason they be out the whole season
It sorta becomes a cycle like hoes bleeding
Im at where you cant come like no semen
No homo, just admire the power
Im so visual, give you an +Eiffel+ like +tower+
Huh, but you can never see me
Black tear compliment my black lips in the Lamborghini
Puffing a spliff big as a branch
After I spit it niggas be swimming to get to land, damn
This is the part where we run Hip Hop
And we dont need props, we know we the shit
This is the part where we run Hip Hop
So get them hands high
Im yelling all my real niggas, keep moving
My real bitches, keep moving
I promise Ima keep moving
If they dont, we do it
The best 
I swear to give you nothing less, nothing less
Jay Rock got flows
Im killing em slow like cigarette smoke
Running Hip Hop like Pac in his prime
I spit murder, every bar is a crime
Look, I do it BIG like B.I
Nigga Im the shit, Ive doing this since knee high
No Im not TIP but I stay on my T.I
These fake ass rappers steady acting like devise
Ima live and die in Cali
Whats beef? Chew through that like rallies
Got hoes, work em out like ballies
Do shows, flip dough like patties
I aint just rapping, I can make it happen
Put your whole goddamn career in a casket
Lyrical homicide when I write
No bullshit, Im Mike with the mic
This is the part where we run Hip Hop
And we dont need props, we know we the shit
This is the part where we run Hip Hop
So get them hands high
Im yelling all my real niggas, keep moving
My real bitches, keep moving
I promise Ima keep moving
If they dont, we do it
The best 
I swear to give you nothing less, nothing less
Never pledge allegiance, God given flow
I can out-preach a deacon once the words get to speaking
Give me a reason why Im not the best breathing
They worship the ground I walk on, though Im harder than cement
Sticking to the streets like convertible oil leaks
Portable handgun, who want to test?
I can pass out many Scantrons, fail many students
Tryna play the truest, dumber than Three Stooges
Hummers, we steady cruising like time do
Higher than a Vanilla Sky, float by you
When Im through, Ill probably let you take it back
Like my old prom suit that I wore with the tag
Rap giant, get your little locality smashed
Money in a bag, stones be yellow as a cat
I like bitches with fat booties but never half-ass
When Im working for certain, Im hurting the game
I said Im hurting her
Pooh! I couldnt help it nigga
I had to put a verse this muhfucker
This shit classic nigga
Feel this, uh, for Hip Hop, for Hip Hop
For real Hip Hop, Hip Hop, Hip Hop
What is life for a nigga like me?
Living out his backpack every night
Needed a new place to sleep
But this is now, nigga
Ones for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready cause I feel I finally did it
Fours for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
Turn that mothafucka to a critic
Man, I got so much shit up on my plate, dog
I was hanging on them corners late
Pockets wasnt straight, bitch
I aint gon make it at this rate, dog, know what Im saying?
Nigga praying up to God just hoping that he hear a nigga
I know the world got more problems and its much bigger
But I figured, Id get some shit up off my chest
To all my niggas I would die for, load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas thatll never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep goin hard, dont let em see you weak
To all my niggas first time stepping in the pen
Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
To all my niggas thats gon fuck around and die today
Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray, just wanna say
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Dont stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Dont stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah
Now how the fuck Im posed to say this?
You see my nigga just lost his son
While Im here hugging on my daughter, I grip her harder
Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinking of some bullshit to tell him
Like Itll be okay, youll be straight, itll be aight
Well, fuck that shit
Whatever you need, yo, I got it!
Whether its money or some weed or putting in work
Fuck it, then Im riding
You know whats up, but now a nigga couldnt stick around
Told myself that after yall moved
That Id be a fuckin fool, to be living by the street rules
Fuck police tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith
Stay strong, bruh, remain solid, bruh
Keep playing ball, cuz
Its the only way up out it, bruh, a nigga proud of ya
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed
Ill have whatever he needs, we the last of a dying breed
Live life, smoke trees
See how far weve come but most, Im sorry for your son
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Dont stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Dont stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah
And you aint gotta shed no tear
Ill be everywhere but Ima always be right here
I aint forgot those years
Ill be everywhere but Ima always be right here
Living in a premature place, wait
Never grow to see the pearly gates, break
Every time a bullet detonate, dates
Of obituary carry crates
Of a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, coming from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didnt hit the block again
Thats because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read gain
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody aint blessed, my nigga
Yes, my nigga, youre blessed, take advantage, do your best, my nigga
Dont stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga
You reject these niggas that neglect your respect
For the progress of a baby step, my nigga
Step-step my nigga, one, two, skip-skip
Back-back, look both ways, pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you cant flip
This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
Get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city youve built
Thats that, dont trip, see money, fuck niggas, dog
It aint nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas, dog
In a minute everybody gon be winning
Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all
Blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Dont stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Yeah, I know, its been a minute
Got to know
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
When you need me 
I wrote my first bars in the car with Stacy
How bizarre, my battle scars at large would lace me
Big marbles, nigga
I lead this new generation, boy, dont argue with us
Marvelous beat selectors, authors and novel spitters
And its all for the literature
And its all for the hideous, the nastiest flows, the chlamydia, uh
I aint afraid to say I need you, ah yeah 
I promise Id never leave you, ah yeah
My life is like twelve open mics of hopeless notes I write
For sure my folks unite soon as the flow get nice, the poltergeist
That scare emcees, my prototype for every, my share of deeds
And R.I.Ps, you know my type of style is like my everything
Apparently my appetite they famished, bite no hand that feed
The culture vulture die and bleed
My focus hold these thoughts and dreams
Control this pen 
Boldest lines of rhymes and things
Devote my time and mind it seems
Supposed to shine, remind Im king
Provoke the blind and bomb the fiends
The pros, the cons of diamond rings
Im full of time but Ima bring
The soul divine and cross between
Whats yours and mines, the goal the green
The roads that show just what it mean
Then grab Shakur right by the wing
And fly before my vocals 
For hip-hop, look at my Ziploc
Bag full of goodies, you Chris Rock, hit the Pookie and piss stops
Since tube socks, baby, you a hell of a drug
Just look over your shoulders when they fuck you over, its love
I know ya
 Dont you know, baby?
Dont you know, baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Yeah yeah, you need me 
Shhh, look over your shoulder, get me?
Cause I done bodied the game to the point niggas scared to rap with me
Kept burnin til they anointed me one of the kings of black history
And yes, I see the game is a little different, niggas lack simply
Them bars and I spit em like darts til they puncture your kidney
You trash and it dont matter how much you gon try to convince me
And you gon make my gun cock and talk a whole nother way, yo
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh 
I am the Buddha, the Ali Baba, the believer-er maker
So pristine, the dice roll from under my sleeve when I shake em
So rude, Im so ice cold but Im what you need to just wake em
All them crowns and medals on the wall waitin for me to just take em
When I arrive, my theme music got a pound to it
And when I leave, even my shadow got a sound to it
Cause Im the god of the harder, the martyr, the father
I spit a saliva thats leaking a lava
Completin the saga while meetin and greetin
And beating you niggas completely and conquer
Extremely bark on a nigga, you see me
And deeply carve up a nigga, believe me
Graffiti your armor, you heebie, you jeebie
Bikini your braud up 
See me now give me the startup and treat me, you greet me
And meet me with arms up
So sweet when I speak, have a seat, it was deep
I was sleep, now the gods up, hmm
Upholding the fundamentals, while most of you boast a rental
Focus on whats most essential, spit bars to provoke your mental
Do I have your attendamiento?
While I clap these raps like thunders
Look over your shoulder boy and wonder
Dont you know, baby? 
Dont you know, baby? 
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me 
Just look over your shoulders!
Whenever you need me 
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Yeah yeah, you need me 
With God watchin over us and me over your shoulders 
But what you gonna do, you pull the devil even closer 
Them clowns that you hang with more ridiculous than white Cleopatra
Or caucasians telling blacks to go back to Africa
But I digress, youre more, but you act less
Why do you act less even still, when the weight of life feels like a boulder 
Im here whenever you need me
When you need me
Whenever you need me, when you need me
Dont you know, baby?
Dont you know, baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders!
Whenever you need me
Just look over shoulders, honey!
Yeah yeah, you need me 
Dont you know baby?
Dont you know baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Dont you know, baby?
Dont you know, baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me
Im always ready for a war again
Go down that road again, its all the same
And Im always ready to take a life again
You know Ill ride again, its all the same
Tell me whos gonna save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me whos gonna save me from this hell
Without you, Im all alone
Whos gonna pray for me? And take my pain for me?
And save my soul for me? Cause Im alone, you see
If Im gonna die for you, if Im gonna kill for you
Then Ill spill this blood for you, hey
I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
Im tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a living hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid aint relief
Earthquake, the body drop, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero?
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero?
My heart dont skip a beat even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption, the souls are suffering men
Clutching on deaf ears again, rapture is coming
Its all prophecy, and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good
Then thats what it gotta be
Whos gonna pray for me? And take my pain for me?
And save my soul for me? Cause Im alone, you see
If Im gonna die for you, if Im gonna kill for you
Then Ill spill this blood for you, hey
Whos gonna pray for me? And take my pain for me?
And save my soul for me? Cause Im alone, you see
If Im gonna die for you, if Im gonna kill for you
Then Ill spill this blood for you, hey
Just in case my faith goes, Ill live by my own
Ill live by my own, Ill live by my own
Kendrick:
Got me breathing with dragons
I crack the egg on you bastard
Why you step to the master
Like you sick with this
I really do this shit
You not equivalent to the Kdot the almighty
Watch this, I will body
Anybody in the crowd
You want me john gotti, couldnt see me
You peeping this is freestyle off top of the dome
Ill let you know why every other rapper need to go home
This a new verse, I put rappers in new hearse
I take rappers to new church
Who wanna see me, you first
Then him second, then you third
Nouns, my verbs
Battle these words
Nigga that shit is absurd
Troi Breeze:
OK if Im 2nd or Im 3rd
Whatever he just said you heard
But Im coming through and I think that I got a new verse
Goin off the top of the dome
Im really tryna change the way that Ive been livin at home
Im really doin it
Nigga I be doin this
Nigga I come through with this
Nigga I will do it and I swear I am so studious
Nigga Im a student and I peeped the way you did it
Now Im bout to do it off of the top of the fuckin tip
Kendrick:
If you bout to do off of the top, then fucking did it
If you say that you the best, then nigga wont you admit it
I see you got the waves in your hair i been there
Back in 8th grade, when the pussy i was scared
But now im seeing all kinds of woman in peripheral
This is individual, this here is a ritual
This here is spiritual
This is not rap , this is god body
Nigga this aint nothing close to lyrical
Troi Breeze:
Shit all Im sayin now is I agree with you
I been grownin in it like I was a tree with you
Now Im tryna do it like I was a seed and I grew up
And now Im blessed like I just sneezed; hachew
I really appreciate it
I really appreciate you callin me up cause Im out here and Im ballin it up
Taking the biggest shots, and now I been getting it tryna spend the biggest knots
Cause Im really out here tryna grind for my family
Tryna go off of that energy, I know you feel my inner G
My brotha was from Piru
My pops was from whats he was raised out on Grape Street
Kendrick:
Well if ya brother was from Piru and your partna was from Watts
Then you should already know about them Compton blocks
All my niggas thats with me is from the city
All my niggas hold choppas and they be with me
And this is TDE this is stri-stri- strictly for my niggas and bitches tell me you with me
You see that scream right there, thats that scream that every other rapper scared
Thats that scream that every other clapper scared
They dont want shoot back
If they did they would get bitch slapped like my nigga Snoop Dogg back in 94
This is Kurupt flow
This is the LBC shit
This the Compton DPGTDE shit
FUCK WITH ME SHIT
Make some noise for my nigga
Troi Breeze:
My name is Troi Breeze
Kendrick:
Make some noise for Troi Breeze
Theres a new crew taking over hip-hop, and everybodys trying to be down.I try to stay in my own little bubble and not think about how people view me, cause if you do that, its very quick that you can go crazy.Kendrick Lamar: That’s crazy.
XXL: What?
KL: TMZ.
XXL: How did you break into that world? You’re like a little backpack rapper, and then all of a sudden TMZ cares about what you’re doing.
KL: That world is The Matrix. I don’t understand that world—that’s The Matrix.
XXL: Is it really like they say, that it happens fast? Even though you’re moving real slow and then—
KL: Yeah, that’s very true. That’s very true. It definitely happens fast, but not fast in the sense, saying you didn’t put in the work—I’ve been doing this for ten years—but when that light beams on you, it happens fast from an aspect where you’re doing so much every day you’re not really aware of the attention that you’re getting, ’cause you’re doing interviews, you do a show, then you do a studio, it’s just a constant, daily plan, so you can’t look at yourself. You can’t be in the crowd looking at yourself on stage, you know. I can only look in the mirror and know I’m Kendrick, and see that same little boy I seen seven years , but I can’t see what everyone else sees. So more and more, I’m really unfazed by it as more and more success is hitting me and I’m not really sure . It’s a tricky thing, for sure.
XXL: What’s your day-to-day been like for the past few months? Has it been mostly touring and interviews? Have you back in the studio? Do you write often? Where are you at, as an artist?
KL: I’ve been on the road for the most part. But at the same time I gotta stay creative, I gotta stay writing—I’m usually writing every day. I can’t miss a day without writing, whether it’s a line, a verse, or an idea. I always have to have that creative flow going.
XXL: When you say you write, what’s your writing process like? Are you writing or are you just thinking shit in your mind?
KL: The process for my first album, my debut album, and even music prior to that, it’s always been like 50/50. I have some songs where I just went in the booth and just got the thoughts off and I didn’t want to feel like I was confined with a sheet of paper. Some records, I may sit with it and have scraps of napkins everywhere, and papers everywhere scattered, then piecing up them ideas together and putting them to songs. It really depends on what I’m feeling at the time.
Everybody wanna play that tough guy
Til them things come out and them shots fly
Say your last words homie and its bye bye
You shouldnt have been playin with me
Everybody wanna play that tough guy
Til them things come out and them shots fly
Say your last words homie and its bye bye
You shouldnt have been playin with me
I aint no killer but dont push me
Them very words said can resurrect Pac straight from the dead
And it takes a young nigga like me to push the limit
No gimmick, this is real homie
I wake out of my sleep, sweat drippin off my face and cheek
I swear to God, death callin for me
Thats why I carry a heat, roamin these streets til they come and get me
Cause ninety percent of them are comin with me
C4 your car doors and watch your shit blow in a jiffy
Quick, boom, explode when I empty
Im on the edge so please dont tempt me to jump
I walk around with a pump, just to scatter you punks heads
Then go and get some head by that woman you want
She does what I says, I says what I does
Crazy back then, yeah thats what I was
But now Im psycho, mental nigga, holdin a grudge
I put a hole in your mug, and let the blood leak out
Until it fill up a tub, then put your son in it
This is no image, this is ether
Cocaine, reefer, alcohol mixed with it
They tried to label your boy as a menace
Put me in some records, along with Guinness
I just started, I aint finished
Chest to your head, until all you motherfuckers diminish
I hope yall ready to ride
Cause its do or die
If not, stay inside
I hope you ready
If not, be quiet
Cause when shots fly
Somebody will cry
I hope you ready
I hope yall ready to ride
Cause its do or die
If not, stay inside
I hope you ready
If not, be quiet
Cause when shots fly
Somebody will cry
I hope you ready
K. Dot
Dave
Watch how K. Dot move, something not like you
Have your gun by you, cause niggas will try you
Watch how K. Dot move, something not like you
Have your gun by you, cause niggas will try you
Uh
Whos sick as me?
Tell the truth, bitch, nobody, and thats real
And as far as my eyes can see
Im the only one fucking with me
Myself, so put your album right back on the shelf
And let real business get dealt
You ladies man like Leon Phelps
I pee on any man tryna discontinue my health
I dont give a damn on how you feel or how you felt
Your small mercy wont help
When shots circle around your waist like designer belts
I design your face, the tray hitch lift ya up
Rock niggas like Bobby Boucher, you waterboy
What you want, weed, dope, or water, boy?
Its right here, and yall catch up, I move fast like light years
Now its back to the basics
K. Dots nothing to play with
A nigga tried to test my gangsta
I pulled out a weapon and aced it
My grade point average at the top of the brackets
Im sick like a cancer patient
Assist many players like personal agent
Yall as foul, clothes to fragrance
Im the best now
Plus the kid married to rap, old cats need to renew ya vows
Sit down, practice your verbs and nouns
Cause Im on the verge to progressin my words
Im the best you heard today, hands down
So hand down whatever you had
Like you been in a bag
Put it in garbage or trash, Im the best you had
Ever since, oh yeah, intelligence
K. Dot, so heaven sent
It aint hard to tell that I live in hell
Sin City watch city gotta get your mail
How I sleep when I die thats real
Theres only two ways out: living under the dirt or life in the cell
Im still on the block tryna make me a sell
You cant make too much, some niggas might tell
Thats how it is homie, when you up in your shit
Get locked up, your friends might hook on your bitch
Its fuck a ho, thats why Im all about my chips
To live and die broke, its some embarrassing shit
Thats why Im hooking a block, fuck hooking a bitch
When the wars on, Im bustin em clips
Shit Im just trying to stack paper
Blowing big weed, Im high like a skyscraper
L.A nigga in a New York state of mind
When I rhyme verses like Cool J back in 85, Im hot lava
Gold ds on my low rider 45 so original like a ol timer
2 pistols, one llama
In the back of the trunk like who want drama? nobody
Sitting back I got this, a project prophet
I could predict when my goons ready to pop shit
When the funds is low
Were on the hunt for tons of blow
Summer time, in Cali homie all we do is snow
Counting dollars, til our hands get callused
Wont stop hustling til the judge bang the gaval
Prayin for the better days
Sit in the club celebrate
Pop bottles, with top models back on the interstate
Traffic and chickens homie we trying to get it
Then we back in the kitchen whipping like a chemist
Hunger pangs got me acting a fool in that dinner time
Life is like a racing track trying to get to the finish line
Slaughter pigs like farmer John
My style got its own ambience
You feel my presence? live life like everyday class in session
Learn something after 187 we burn some
For real kid, our uncle doing a 13 year bid
I pray to god he dont come out how he went in
Gets ill, these streets got me packing a 9 mill
My mind stay black, either kill or be killed
Its real in the battlefield son
Last week shawty do wop he at the ooh wop he said he ready to kill some
I said shawty chill, you aint ready for that type of drama
Plus karma for real
He shook his head, horizontal
He said he was out on consignment some dudes on the block tried to rob em
Try? what you mean?
He said they tried until I reached in to the pocket of my jeans
I killed 2, but one got away which is bad news, because the hood didnt even cover my whole face
And I know he be back, but before he do that
I bring it to him first on the porch where he live at
Damn shawty I cant knock you, its survival of the fittest
With that said, do what you got to
I shook his hand, then I walked away, then reality took a toll on me
Shoulda never gave him that .38
Looking at the ceiling in my bedroom
Then the phone rang, hey K Dot turn on the news
They didnt even say his name
But I knew it was him when it said another 7th grader was slayed
It aint hard to tell
When I first wanted to rap
I cant front man I fronted the facts
Fabricated every single statement that I ever made
At a young age said Im running wit gats
No body shots man Im coming for hats Im at cha melon
Cool guy in real life but Im a felon
On tracks
Then I set my pants on fire
Liar liar singing to the choir let me fall back
Then I fell on my knees and said oh Lord please a young fella need help
Told me He was all I need to love everybody else including myself
I love myself
And its okay you feel a type of way
Aint nothin corny bout dat
I love myself
Im a Christian rapper I aint no actor man Im really bout dat
My lifestyle realer than its ever been
Even though you might be thinking its irrelevant
Its realer
Fo realer
On my mama I aint never been a killa
In 06 I wanted them to trust us
So I said I was the hope pheind hustler
And then I dropped A note for the hopeless
That was 09 when I got focused
Just being honest if they looking they can find us cause we out here hiding in the open
Been grindin but it aint mere talent
Its an honor I could ever be a spokesman coaching
Players in the game of life
Might look like a dealer but we aint alike
And I aint better
I aint said I was a angel at all
But I aint finna stand here like
I dont love myself
Im just trying to figure things out
Has there ever been anybody to ever take the same route
Qualified by the streets I was raised
8yrs young when I caught my first fade
5yrs young when I think I got saved
Got my testimony on the block in PA
Plenty things God used to bring about change
I could load em up and let em go like a gun range
I remember they was blowing kush in my face
Told me I was broke go ahead and smoke
Might as well wallow in ya sorrow
Unless you hit the lotto go and hit the bottle
Nope
Couldnt make me sell crack either
And I was trying to get chicken like the next man
Heard a false preacher say I need a bankroll so I was praying for the green like a jets fan
When I think back
Bout where where I aint yet
I couldve went and got it all like a blank check
Could be mad that I aint got a hundred Js
All up on the stage wit a hundred chains
But I am a good father to my kids
Made a honest woman out of their mother
And I love her like cake on the plate of a fat kid
Im real I aint gone walk up on you like a undercover
Came as I was to the throne of Heaven and made a shameless plug
In the name of Christ Lord take my life
I know ya pain is love
Martin Luther King went to jail over 14 times and he aint a thug
So where you think Im going huh?where the prophecy going or to hang at the club
Ive lost my head
I must misread what the good book said
It woes me be, its a jungle inside
I give myself again until the well runs dry, I
I love myself 
On my mama I aint never been a killa
Blewell jeans, Moby Dick stitching
Trigger finger itching
To trouble one of you niggas
Im daring one of you niggas to jump
Ima snatch you out pistol whip you
Then put you back in the trunk
Shit, Im back in the front
The front page of the newspaper
They say Im seeing more paper... true
But only if you knew that
I was in your house right now taking the paper from you
Where ya safe at?
Chick is swinging on the dick like a fucking bat
And catch it all like an umpire
Ima go hard, rims bigger than the fucking car
Baby girl say why the fuck you even got tires?
I dont know, just get inside
And never question my shit again ho
I fold dough like a notebook
I see money, you pass it up like Magic Johnson no look
Who the fuck taught you niggas how to cook
Thats what Im hearing up in your song
Beat said if youre cooking up the product and your wrist dont hurt when you do it then youre doing it wrong
Yeah, I like it
Love, lets talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? 
I know the feeling haunt you 
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Tell me what you gon do to me
Confrontation aint nothin new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you cant bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I dont even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy cause I aint invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin?
Mothafucka, I dont even like you
Corrupt a mans heart with a gift
Thats how you find out who you dealin with
A small percentage who Im buildin with
I want the credit if Im losin or Im winnin
On my momma, thats the realest shit
Love, lets talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? 
I know the feeling haunt you 
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Love, lets talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? 
I know the feeling haunt you 
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Seasons change
Theres still time for us to run away
Seasons change
Theres still time for us to run away
Seaso—
Closed eyes, thats how you runnin from your destiny
Superpowers cant relieve that
Dear God, why cant you keep me from these outsiders?
Were outside, outside, out 
Still runnin, cant let this jungle get the best of me
Superpowers cant relieve that
Dear God, why cant you keep me from these outsiders?
Were outside, outside, out
Closed eyes, thats how you runnin from your destiny
Superpowers cant relieve that
Dear God, why cant you keep me from these outsiders?
Were outside, outside, out 
Still runnin, cant let this jungle get the best of me
Superpowers cant relieve that
Dear God, why cant you keep me from these outsiders?
Were outside, outside, out
Lyrics from Snippet
-buss an A
Hol up, I never had smudge on my name 
Born the same year but we can’t save the same
My d-
You know Im surgical with this bitch Jake
How you want it dawg?
Closed Casket?
Remember that fool in a wheelchair?
How you think he got there?
I got my air-conditioning on right now
Real cool about it
Oil talking please
Slick with it
Wanna know what death feel like
I suggest that you stay in the house at night
The scope that I got for the long rifle fit pretty damn right
Plus my connect got a pretty good price
I could take off your neck with just one slice of the blade
No, Im not Wesley Snipes
One cut can have her screaming out first aid
Been this way ever since first grade
Forte demeanour was to get paid
Birthday solution was to shoot straight
Thirteen I was ready for gunplay
Stand on the block taking pay
I get four shots like a freak oh he know
Not to fuck with K-D-O-T
Oh, I forgot
Never come around here without a Glock
You want beef with your boy
Nigga I put heat on your boy
Leave him tied up on the back seat
With your boy duct taped wont let out noise
Oh yes we got them toys
Oh yes we got them choppas
LAPD they cant stop us
Rockets shoot down helicopters
In the kitchen 
Betty Crocker 
Got kick 
You hate 
You wait 
One sec 
Ill be back we then gon west
No vest, Ima aim at your face
Unless you can stop them
Im so throwed
Oh yes people there is a problem
I say
(Know what Im talking bout?
I can feel that lane
Sometimes I just lay back and let them look at me
Im so too
You see they be loving the oil talk
Its real slick for them
I keep the air conditioning on
Cool, cool, cool)
Pop shots yeah we kill niggas
On the real nigga
Run when I flex the steel
Coming with a to grill niggas
Save on the ounce but dont know the price
But I know one time aint bust late night
Trying to set me up so I gotta think twice
Aint no fucking with it Ima let em plague mic
I keep a nine for you dummies then I split your brain
Im going to your safe, take your cash, cocaine
All your weed in your range cause youre going platinum chains
And when I leave I your white carpet got a stain
Watch as my city get gritty
Fuck pity, we gon do you niggas shitty
Domino effect when we spray them with the semi
Big k-holes in your dodge you can hear me
Front to back
Stack for stack
Nigga go clip for clip
Either gat for gat 
Wise niggas better check my stacks
We let the match ratatat
And all the heads we crack
Stacked, lots of cheese
Tryna cop the gs
 mac sale when we pop the fees
Cop the keys
To the boss got rocks to feed
Roster fees
Cause aint nobody stopping me
I got a flow so cold
Style so bold
A nigga run up, I leave his face all swole
Hit him with the 8 better yet with the 4
And I dont feel bad he put himself in the hole
West coast in motion
Promoting another episode
Down south them niggas get whilst we be getting
I remember making bedroom hits, and now were counting this
Then I took the Selfie, this aint healthy, kids aint down with this
Wanna meet the plan I took for granted til the xanax hits
I cant even read it, cause Im the one to kill the analysts
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Dont let me down, were back in town for the greatest, funk
Were just playing around and I still miss my momma, funk
Chris Martin in my apartment, how the fuck we do this, funk
The Sick Boy just went viral
Platinum going on the top, Billy Idol
Alex P on TMZ, hello like Lionel
Theres levels to it, you and I know
Bitch, be humble

, sit down, be humble 
Sit down, be humble, bitch, sit down
These songs arent for the critics, theyre for every kid at home
That wants to push the limits and
These songs are not for the critics, theyre for every kid at home
That wants to push the limits and
These songs are not for the critics, theyre for every kid at home
That wants to push the limits and not...
These songs are not for the critics, theyre for every kid at home
That wants to push the limits, sit down

Bitch, sit down

Bitch, sit down
Kendrick Lamar:
What inspired me as a kid really was, uh, illustrating my thoughts on that sheet of paper
Lifes to me like a box of chocolates
 something for something, thats the obvious
Flows so sick, dont you swallow it
Biting my style, you 
Come from the same blocks where they pick cotton
Oh, you forgotten, ah, forget it
That life aint sane
You see gangbanging, drug paraphernalia. You see things from the streets. So what you gon do? You gon find something that you love to do and have a passion for it, or you gon stay, you know, mingling in the streets until something major happens
So the moment I defined myself and freed myself was the time I locked myself in the studio and said, You need to do music.
Tonights for everybody, understand me
The plan B is the one in your hearts
This here is family, Kendrick Lamar
Words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
Marching on Rosecrans in Compton
You cant cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
Im on point like period
Ive been there and gone before you get near it
Ooh wee, that boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
The way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in
Thats family, God and honor
From Chicago, my daddy and my momma
Came into Compton to accomplish one thing: reign supreme
Raise a king named Kendrick
I aint lying, it stand for King and I am one
My unborn son and grandson will live royal
From the coochee to the soil
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Well, Ive had this world since birth
Feel the good kids hunger
The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger
But its muscle in my heart
I stare in the eyes of Mozart and tell him Im the genius
I love myself, really love myself
And I means this with all sole
And you cant control greatness less you hating
With the heart of Satan
But even that cant stop it
I tell em, Get out my wallet and passion in your logic
Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me
And if you say it aint, you may offend me
Damn, that boy good
Im bright as Thomas Edison but Im Gucci Mane in the hood
I stood alone for so long, prolonged my whole career
But now Im here, you can shoot shots and cheer
Because I am, we are Kendrick Lamar
Getting into that success level where you can go back to your neighborhood and people feel like, you know, uh, they look up to you. Sometimes the most riskiest things you can do can end up being, you know, the most important. Yeah
Teriq Tyson:
My dreams more vivid than Dr. Ts, evolutionary
Reporting live, Centennial High, 2014
Kendrick Lamar:
I am Kendrick. I am Kendrick. I am Kendrick. I am Kendrick
I can think of a million reasons, have it all as your seasons
Say no more I feel ya b, say no more I feel ya homie
We traveled the Neverlands, fireworks in the south of France
Take it down and come again, again
But look
You dont get too dirty in my whip. whip, whip, whip
Keep it nice and flirty in my whip, whip, whip whip
Pop your pretty ass up in my whip, we gonna make it last up in my whip
Scorpio, talk to me, talk to me
Capricorn, talk to me, talk to me
I am a sinner whos probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I dont understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Its just been one of them weeks
Ruslan
Look, I should really be workin on my album right now
But I couldnt help myself
Please dont kill my vibe, please dont kill my vibe
Please dont kill my vibe, please dont kill my vibe
Look inside of my eyes and you will soon find a greener eclipse
Tryna get though, from the get-go
You the blacks dont miss
Hey, it could feel the strangest
It could feel like you and your best friend are now becoming strangers
I can tell you that I have failed you
But you tell me Im brainless
And I cannot change this
How can I say the scripture
When the ? for blind, it may not hit ya
Went on the road and I came back a star
Think that I made it and I am in charge
Seeing me different and thinkin I switched
Man, this whole process is feeling bizarre
Im just happy to be out of my script
Tell me why you think Im different again
Taken for granted and then well be missed
Taken for granted, later will be missed
I can feel the changes
I can feel the same people round me, now they thinkin Im famous
My savior saved me, my city made me
And put me on stages
To me thats amazing
To you thats outrageous, hate this
But please shutup, let me say this
I am a sinner whos probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I dont understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Please dont kill my vibe, please dont kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from three planets away
I got my Word, I got my music
I would share it but today Im singin
Please dont kill my vibe, please dont kill my vibe
Please dont kill my vibe, please dont kill my vibe
Im tryna to stay on the path, and not look on back to what we once was
You tryna churn into somethin
Tip on that malt to get you that uuz
Feelin the rapture
We live in a world, we live in a world
That wants to laugh at ya
We live in a world
I could be honest, I know they dont hear us
They carousel ? life continues propellin us
Forward, they just wanna put us on the auction block but theres no way they sellin us
Worth more than minimum wage
Forever you could relate
Any subliminal
Back in my criminal days, I would stil live in a way
That was reciprocal, this was nothin I could change
So the Messiah was slain
Wow, what a miracle
Opened the door to be saved
Jesus opened the door for all of us to be saved
 + 
They ? like this
Been a long time, cant you see the Lord smiling
They waitin on ? heart, the tank is all empty
Xs in the air, and they do it by instinct
Hide your children, hide your children
We are not better than you
Please dont put any of these rappers on a pedastal
Please dont kill my vibe, please dont kill my vibe
We dont wanna hear anymore of your lies
My New Years resolution is the Kings Dream movement
Shut your whole thing down, dont you question what Im doing
Please dont kill my vibe, please dont kill my vibe
Please dont kill my vibe, please dont kill my vibe

Sound without Focus... is just noise
With so much knock in the LBC
It was hard not to claim that DPG
Summertime popped in the L-A-C
With the music courtesy of D-A-Z
And the Soopa, Doopa, Fly for the troopers
Riders, supers, hoes, groupies
All of em with the short tight jeans on
Lets Play House all of em theme song
Word on the gangsta, squad up
Black, brown, throw a St. Ides up

Come up out that shithole, gotta get this money
Long Beach, CR, all this shit is sunny
Put the monkey in it like the shit is funny
Banana clip Ras about to split this dummy
The funk just told me to kick back
I like revenge, retaliation and get back, nigga
Got more bars than Kit-Kat
Get smacked like Kat Stacks if you lift, Jack
A motherfucker better recognize
With a flick of my wrist like Kevorkian, you all die
All I do was ball high
Trying to stay above the rim like a tall guy
That niggas ass super fly
Yall ride Lexus, , left lane, tall ride
OG to BG, I tried to warn ya
Only in California
Only in L.A, Only in L.A
Where the gangsters play, Where the gangsters play

Gangsters killing, you wanksters quit filling your iPods up with classics
Ain’t a nigga out can out-match them adlibs
DPGC general

Yeah, its like that cause I was taught that
Back when Dog Food dropped in the Compton swap meet parking lot
Daddy rehab three, so going to my pops we was popping now
The trunk in the caddy was rocking now
Slap a nigga in the face with a little waist, even make Pac salute
Snare like a bear trap, theyre imperible too
Bear witness
Kids like Barry Bonds, thats the realest, nigga
Only in L.A, Only in L.A
Where the gangsters play, Where the gangsters play
Catching up on fame
Summertime in, West Coast ride

West Coast Predator, every day is like chow
Wont B-5, put your whole career in the clouds
We came in this industry, we screamin fuck yall
Till I came on the industry, you see me grip my balls
Here I go again, lost one, never
More wins than Chicago weather
New year, new endeavor
Reach goals better than David Beckham, out of control
Kick it to my shoe, glued to your rectum, your asshole
Californ-I-A, tiI disintegrate interstate 105
We ride, you imitate
We eliminate anybody that penetrate any kind of negative vibe
Temperature rise
Southern Cali sun, shades over eyes
Never wear suits, but keep corporate ties
Like I do 
Soul brother, number deuce, Lil Petrusse
I be over the edge like Q in Juice
Through and through, back to back hits like profile views
Or fiends strung out, keep watchin
I bring the heat to your closet, make your team run out
Honest, I gets down and I look at the chronic and say
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Im in the 745 and I call it the Black Knight
My music get you high, remind me of crack pipes
Flip ya boy up, before they stitch ya boy up
And we stump ya homie out, they wont pick ya boy up
I aint playin with em, Ill choke you dummy
We in the streets, tryna get this Oprah money
So you better give me mine, cause Id love to take it from ya
You internet bangers, we bangin out around ya
Hey, I hear skills still slept on, maybe I recollect wrong
Maybe me writing in retrospect that kept home at a standstill
Me and my Chevrolet roam
The song of salvation until my larynx gone
Never rigid in resurrection was never set in stone
Plagiarist proof endeavors embedded this alone
The subject at hand as if my predicates on song
Set precedent -- Im addressing the elements indulged
In finesse, your less eloquent rhetoric is strong
Where I reside at, I see irrelevance condoned by the delegates
Their regression is evident they own
What I been off, fuck it since its the samaritans I sold
Ima represent for self in detrimental tone
And Im taking the front runner of presidential poles
No arrogance, shit I just got my on
Vulgarity is - the only heir apparent to the throne
Cant run in the Serengeti in the 
Young and Im ions beyond the box
Flow free on, but still will Ghost Recon a cop
So phenomenal by design, we still pushing the envelope
No keyage to vote, but uh, most agree I am hope for the coast
Low key Im consulting the triage of folks
On me Im the most slept on
Stepped on, step songs, father of rap songs
Writing my wrongs, writing the book of psalms
This is the word, word to the Holy Quran
Or whatever thats foreign to you
I find it funny that you embracing the storm
Wake up, ring the alarm
Or wake up with a bomb through ya
Its Baghdad, kids with bad dads
Cops with bad badges
Big bullets, no my bads when them guns shoot you
Mykestro, I might go out as the Mike Jordan
Lacing my Jordans and yelling out ISO
Ike Turner your idol, whip him and bruise him
Stick poison inside of his pipe-hole, sad that you knew him
We influence the heart of thousands
Thats nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand but whos counting
Thirsty for success and we drink from the youth fountain
Big-headed tryna stay grounded like a delinquent in middle school clowning
Drowning MCs, they want life jackets
While we swim backwards, we yellin nigga please!
Pay your respect and recognize the alphabet
You cant survive in a room full of Gs
Coached by my Uncle Lil Mane, I resemble him
They tryna steal the game, and we killing all thieves
Make them draw blood, let them all bleed
Motherfucker die, put a ribbon in the sky, tell Stevie Wonder sing
King of all kings, Joker and new jacks will get dealt with
Royal flush when I drop shit and say these things
Man I lean on them cause half these niggas Maybelline: all made up
Im about to go dummy on a dummy what-what
Treat some like welterweights stuff in some trunks
Fucking with a giant, Im Forest Whitaker sparring with some Forest Gumps
What you want!
What a dilemma tryna deal in charts
What incentive? See Ima definitive nigga for starts
No one similar, iller the way I deliver they harp
I be rhythm and riddlin, settin the symbols and sentiments
Diligence, then again I did administer art
In percentages, this is just another sinister star
So consider this exhibition as a privileged par
And watch the metal arc, lemon my part
Shits riveting what Ive written til a nigga depart
By the dividend, considering the withering of words
Nothing realer than the urge to revisit all the shit I been hearing
Emerge through provision and of nerve
We stern, this here is endearing and deserved
Nothing like yall as far as error is concerned
You dont know about us, then your earrings to the curb
Sermons be piercing to your courage
For real -- Against All Odds -- Im the fiercest with the term
The nonchalant nod when the iffiness occurs
Hella picky and its sweated out the prissiest of perms
I walk in the room, bitches Vickys get submerged
Shit that used to be clear, the vindictive be the blurred
And I aint satisfied til the dense of me can splurge
At the embassy my enemies can burn
I defer all amenities with hopes that my sins will be adjourned
Niggas diddle my abilities, the remedy concern
We at SkillStillAppeal, let the chemistry converge
And the trilogies, the humility is in the urn
You aint feeling me, the new humidity is here
Im so in between being Kenny G and Murs
If shit dont blend like Hennessy and 
I encourage infamy, you get an empty me and turn
I return before tables get turned
It’s my turn, spur of the moment
I re-produce my sperm and try to clone it, stand firm
Bumping The Firm, Phone Tap, I’m on it
I slaughter every opponent to bits of components, potent
You can’t fuck with the horse power, your woofing too much
Y’all bout to hoarse coward, as soon as I buss, pause
You put your hands on a broad and telling me you can brawl
You thought you saw me when you saw Saw, frightening
More reckless than a paisa driving without a license
Hittin’ your new truck then leaving you hiking
They said no, the industry let it go
I cracked the window then hit the back door like trick dices
Stickin’ and movin and movin’ and stickin’ the prices
Uppin’ the ante before Im a antique, can promise you hear me clear
Even if you eat 3 ears with Tyson
Rippin’ the panties but bootin’ the wammys
They dyke and I’m liking them all, I’m siftin’ through panties
Haters’ll spike it
Voicing opinions but holding laryngitis
See I don’t hear ‘em, I’m a winner by law
Track em down like the subway when they sub-par
Sub-zero everytime I jump in the synagogues
Send the angels, send the God
I can make you look hard, I know
I just let the thoughts take its toll
More sentences than level four yard, Bogard
Go hard, black tar, concrete, Tom Vick times Papi Mason times 3
Uncle Toms need Tums to stomach atomic bombs
Or die from my Wizardry
RZA, GZA, Method Man
I’m a Killer Bee, killer! Be killed, make your embassy yield
This is not your cup of tea, and oh
They say waters run deep, dive in, Bermuda triangles
And you will see us, we must leave dust behind
Emcee’s duck, deduct, revenue declined
When we touch down like a Running Back’s grind
Can you keep up or keep away for keepsake
And fuck!
We must leave dust behind
Emcee’s duck, deduct, revenue declined
When we touch down like a Running Back’s grind
Can you keep up, you keep a safe for keepsake
That aint safe - Bluh!
Im wakin up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
Im breathin in the chemicals
Im breaking in, shaping out, checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, whoa
Im wakin up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa, Im radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, Im radioactive, radioactive
I raise my flags, dye my clothes
Its a revolution, I suppose
Well paint it red for the blood that rose
Whoa
Im breakin in, shapin up
Checkin out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa
Im wakin up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa, Im radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, Im radioactive, radioactive
All systems go, the sun it hasnt died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside
Bury me alive, bury me with pride
Bury me with berries, that forbidden fruit and cherry wine
Thank you berry much, but tonights my night and Im Barry Bonds
Swingin for the fences, barbaric Kendrick in idle time
Everything in lifes subject to change, change whip, change grind
Change clothes, change opinions, right before I change my mind
I dont really know yah business, been in there since I was bendin Lego blocks
Now you tell the world about me, dry snitch
Tater tots on my shotgun, now I gotta pop one at the stars
Skys the limit, I gotta finish as the first rapper on Mars
Mark my word, Ima make my mark, even when they start their Martial Law
Even when these Martians alienate, my mental state is still at heart
Lord, look in my eyes, tell me I died, tell me I tried, to compromise
Tell me you love me, tell me that I, dont really care and can barely decide
Wishin good luck on my enemies, all of my energy go to the almighty God
I could drown in a bottle of Hennessy, with no amenities, Im gettin better with time
Yeah!
Im wakin up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa, Im radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, Im radioactive, radioactive
Can you feel me with time, can you feel me
Can you feel me with time, can you
Hey

Oh

Pack them in the back of a Reagle, and come clap your people
Ride the track like a Mack truck on diesel, mattafact

Tryna take me out my zone, watch me let three go

Push you to your final destination, hurry up, your casket waiting, who told you put a thought together ?
You brainstormin, I control the weather, im thinking sunshine

Momma off a wine cooler, Magic Johnson played Jordan
I was only four but its like I heard it before
House party crackin off of the music Doctor record
And according to my awareness I was more than coherent
A cold listener, mockin that shit like a parrot
My cousins kickin up dust, Crippin, their flag, wear it
Round their hand like a mitten, aim and use it for leverage
Shittin on Compton sheriffs like Fuck the Police
Woofers and gold Rollies, every swap meet should know me
Cause I copped every record that dropped, dropped a dub
Just to hear Doc drop a jewel for the sake of hip-hop
Whoever thought the moment I seen you on bullets for Cali Love
15 years later youd be savin my life, what?
Bumpin N.W.A., smokin chronic, sippin on gin and juice
Back in 2001, I was smoking on the chronic, too
Now I need a Detox, yeah, yeah, yeah
We cant do the same things that we used to
Nah, nah, oh nah
Yeah, thats cool
Thirty two shots in the clip of his thirty fours a little nigga with heart
Frustrated with being broke while I was climbing the charts
Penitentiary chancin and dancin with suicide
 is connoisseurs, love to eat on our tribe
Homie I got love for him
Angel on angel dust, I used to thug for him
Took me on my first mission, transition
Good kid turned rapper, pay attention
This is deeper than you think
Right after my admission inside the game, asked him bout whats his name
We brushed it off as a joke as we watched her get off the stage
Music award for all of the nominee
I was promised to win, he was promised to leave
With all the favorite accessories
The ones the big budget videos had especially
Just a shadow in the dark, blendin in with all the industry friends
So guess this is where the story begins, J Incredible, what!
Lyrics from Snippets
...always right
And love your mother, shes the reason why were both alive
Thats right, my little butterfly, butterfly, you got a long way to go
Darling, just take it slow
...wonder if theres only a frame
Its whats inside, that heart following love in those veins
I still see Johnny...
My little brotha, we evolve, we evolve like
Butterfly, butterfly, you got a long way to go
Darling, just take it slow
On my momma, Im a get money all day
All night, somethin like 24/7, on my momma
Im a stay fresh all day, all night, somethin like 24/7
On my momma, Im a pull up
Hop out with two of them Top Models
Haters gon hate, but before the ice grill, say, Stop
Look at my motherfuckin wheels
Theyll say its bizack for the first time
Young boy rhyme like 87 Rakim, locked in my own world
No fire hydrant can water down me though
Im a tyrant on Swizz beats, its kind of ironic
Roll up the chronic tree, Hennessy, lets see, can you get like me?
White tee, L.A. fitted, roamin the backstreet
Back trunk, chopper clap back at me
Girls get skeet-skeet on like Little John
BME, I dont save em, even with coupons
Usually I kick game like modern-day Bruce Lee
Raw heat, never paranoid when ridin on deep-dish rims
Fly as Clark Kent, invade the black like a martian
Then say, Pardon me, no, pardon my arrogance
If you dont learnt else about I
Then, motherfucker, you better know this
On my momma, you want to look at my wheels, huh?
On my momma, you want to know how it feel, huh?
To get like me, makin them dollar bills, huh?
Pull up, hop out wit my appeal, huh?
On my momma, she lookin to pop a pill, huh?
On my momma, she lookin to get a thrill, huh?
She want to go home, get that punani killed, huh?
Face down, ass up, she know the drill, huh?
I got a couple of soldiers ready to ride, huh?
It pop off the club, we finna leave outside, huh?
We see you duckin and dodgin, flippin to hide, huh?
On my momma, you play round and lose your life, huh?
Im funky-fresh all night, huh?
Smokin that chronic, high as a kite, huh?
Drinkin that brown bottle on site, huh?
Been pimpin, baby, swear I dont lie, huh?
Look at my motherfuckin wheels
Look at my motherfuckin wheels
Look at my motherfuckin wheels
Look at my motherfuckin wheels
You aint got to front, homie
Look at my motherfuckin wheels
Or look at me, look at my motherfuckin wheels
I said, You aint got to front, homie
Look at my motherfuckin wheels
Or look at me, look at my motherfuckin wheels
I aint gon lie bout it

As my mind drift
Then split, like the middle of a spliff
I began to catapult off the cliff
Of the unknown, I got a feeling in my funny bone
That were not the same, just antonyms of a different age
My soul flock, with the carefree
Words of the wise, I spoke a hundred times like a Goldie
 L-M-F-A-O. I hate yall, but I spread love like mayo
Then spread slugs
My brain matter
Is a brain fatter
See my vision
Or my visionll stare at ya
This is the future if I say so
Yall copping fitted caps
Im about to go and cop a halo
The God of rap and I mean it
I play kickball with Mars
And marbles with Pluto and Venus
Witness the genius
I interact with the inner city villains
That are into your circle
Like a computer hack
Then give you that
Peep the style and the way the cops sweat us
Artillery got a gun for every letter
In the alphabet while your family in pajamas
Ill be stepping in your house like Alpha Beta Gamma
I’m creeping
Got a dorm something decent
Fuck a fist fight the shells bubble
If its beef got the desert double
Still got the work in the duffle
Eat sleep, shit, breathe, Hustle
The game bang russell simmons
Gun tucked under the linen
V12 stock engine 
Don’t worry he’ll be dead in a minute
59 seconds past then I let them shots blast
And I do it quicker than a horny 8 grey class
And sit them in the water like Alcatraz
Don’t bother with the god mc
Godfather, build big dro like Rasta, ya bumbaclot
You got chickens we raid ya spot
Kick in your door waving’ the 4 4
Let it blow like a Chicago snow storm
Even if its 20 below still bear arms
Jay rock, K Dot nigga piss yo pants
 California let me see those hands
We don’t stop, Ingle wood we won’t stop
It’s compton in the house
K-Dot Jay rock nigga shit your drawers
2 deep g rob in your honda accord
Squeezed off on em paramedics tried CPR
And 3/4s of his heart the young boy coughed on em
Who Shot ya ?
5th sing like Sinatra
These hollow tips we call em heart stoppers partner
Red and black impala ride street like patrollie’s
Coached by OG’s to stay low-key 
Sip 40’s and stay with a 4 T
My pockets bo key
Middle fingers up to the compton police
I’m a threat to the law and your flow got too much baking soda pa
It’s pissing your fiends off they be like “now raw?”
I’m outta here K-Dot got that powder for years
So focused we aim straight
4 shots will knock off 6 braids
Been doing this since sixth grade
You wack niggas need first aid
Got me twisted like dreads, I run money with two legs
Jay rock, K Dot nigga piss yo pants
 California let me see those hands
South Central we don’t stop, East LA we won’t stop
Jay rock, K Dot nigga piss yo pants
 California let me see those hands
South Central we don’t stop, East LA we won’t stop
Its 08 let me tell you what they tryna do clone humans
I’m so dope, they want me as two
What are you doing, respect you more if you called it a truce
But we burn white flags, so its probably no use
They tell me we hot, I’m looking like who?
Probably in heaven is the only time you couldn’t show me some proof
Until then keep stepping’ while I act a animal in the booth
You looking at the one man sitting zoo, Pity the fool thats denying the truth
I’m the word like bible study you heard class is over my toddlers
Top Dawg Enterprise
You went for ? get sprayed like insectiscide
Count hundred dollar bills for exercise
No money printer, just paper splinters
Yeah you hating ass niggas cry a river
Jay rock, K Dot nigga piss yo pants
 California let me see those hands
Carson we don’t stop, Longreach we won’t stop
Jay rock, K Dot nigga piss yo pants

This is your education, learn not to be a hater
Moving up like elevators getting close to my destination
Hand this vest and Ill detonate em
Blow up something, thats stress relieving
Im in a world where the money makers get the pleasures
So all the pretty girls will fuck you if youre spinning cheddar
I mean the pussy good, but I feel success is better
The best defense are friends who love you when they felt the pressure
Pressing up and they go compressed and now Im part of their conversations
See my life as less complicated, theyre contemplating my conversation
 my place dont waste my time cause I aint done celebrating
I never thought itd feel this good to say we finally made it
They see me going big, Im making it
Im getting money now but people think Im changing
Now Im just celebrating that we finally made it
You dont like, you dont like what I do
And I swear this shit feel like my birthday
Hub City my birthplace uh
Youd rather roll over than live in a blizzard, or die in an earthquake
This could be a catastrophe, no one got the audacity
To show blasphemy, to the god of rap, nigga I go back like an artifact
And I got my weight up, all is fat is brought to you by
Kendrick and the all-mighty eye, HiiiPower

Visions of Gandhi Baldly Staring at me
They put his face on the money to show him smiling happy
Capitalism, I cant hold on for very long
So place your visions on paper im getting very shabby
Godly speaker, play messiah, Holy Swiggy, Pass a beaker, Place a order... Hallelujah to the very greedy
From the Back i Boo
They Say that im very wrong
My five senses of fuck you are going very strong
Touch my middle finger
Curse with my breath
The sight of a sinner, hear the footsteps of death
My heated arguments, make your book shelfs to melt
And in the pursuit of taste, serve yourself instead
You see im Brahmin, man i never heard a pistol
But my ancestors got the Pig Fat cartridges to bite into
Buddist Laws forbid you
You kinda miss the issue
The British came convinced you for the trade
They took your tissue
Like you
Slaves!!
Slaves to Hii Power
Slaves!!
Slaves to Hii Power
Slaves to your MRS
Food for though bitches
Everybody Slaves, we fall for those riches
Uh, me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish 
Hit the house lick: tell me, is you wit it, ya bish? 
Home invasion was persuasive 
From nine to five I know it’s vacant, ya bish 
Dreams of livin life like rappers do 
Back when condom wrappers wasnt cool 
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros 
Then Usher Raymond Let It Burn came on 
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish 
Park the car, then we start rhymin, ya bish 
The only thing we had to free our mind 
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs 
You lookin like a easy come-up, ya bish 
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish 
And thats a lifestyle that we never knew 
Go at a reverend for the revenue
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin
Everybody gon respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And thats just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That’s just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That’s just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
Thats just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That’s just how I feel
Dreams of livin life like rappers do 
Bump that new E-40 after school 
You know, “Big Ballin With My Homies” 
Earl Stevens had us thinkin rational 
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish 
Another casualty at war, ya bish 
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head 
He said one day Ill be on tour, ya bish 
That Louis Burger never be the same 
A Louis belt will never ease that pain 
But Ima purchase when that day is jerkin 
Pull off at Churchs, with Pirellis skirtin 
Gang signs out the window, ya bish 
Hopin all of em offend you, ya bish 
They say your hood is a pot of gold 
And we gon crash it when nobodys home

Pick your poison, tell me what you doin
Everybody gon respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever

Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!

Pick your poison, tell me what you doin
Everybody gon respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever

With past of Trinidad
 plenty hash up in the stash
When you got gangsta black up in the back room
When I walk back, more vicious than wildcats
I would have swallowed that
Nickerson Garden projects gain the profit
Of my lyrical content
Build a monument
Gotta put a clip to your conscience
Watch this, pull up on your block in a stick-shift
Pop six, watch you fall just from the fifth hit
The spliff lit, when Im high cant I spit sick
First round, number one draft on shit
Got the mind of a chief, the heart of a soldier
With a rifle got a hell of a range like rover
And the fight, got a hell of a strike like vipers
When the gat, got a hell of a aim like snipers
You wanna act tough
Lets see if you really are, when this gun busts
Oh you say you want war, nigga lets go
Bring the drama, thats on my momma
You dont wanna rumble

Let me see if you really hard, when this gun busts
Oh you say you want war, nigga lets go
Bring the drama, thats on my momma
You dont wanna rumble

Since VapoRubs moms got my Nyquizzle

Trying to make a buck slinging weed and E pizzles
My nigga hit me up, and as far the stizzle
Ill eat your ass up show you how a bullet fizzle
Get your ass touched one hand on your whizzle
The other on the clutch, my middle finger up
Shit Im not giving a fuck
Catch me on Rosecrans and Central leanin like Im supposed to
My brain is mental a nigga stay focused
Plus Im in the hood with the hood rats and roaches
Caught crack, and served a three-fifth on my culture
Desert Eagle on me these niggas acting like vultures
I aint dying homie I swear that your thoughts is bogus
Keep the iron on me Ill crease you flat if you approach us
Acting how you act you gone get some out of that holster
You wanna act tough
Lets see if you really are, when this gun busts
Oh you say you want war, nigga lets go
Bring the drama, thats on my momma
You dont wanna rumble

My momma never raised a punk, nigga I aint a chump
You disrespect youll be on my thump
Ghetto kill, make you lift up
You dont wanna get struck
Like a match, got a back
Thatll break a shit bruh
I attack with a Mac, thatll tear your shit up
Now the paramedics gotta come and make that pick up
Dog, I hit your block in a pick-up
Jay Rock Im me, a lion, a man, a 
I do it by myself, with a hook and an uppercut
Doctor got a stitch you up
Nigga are you real or what
Im a little guy but Im tough
I hit hard then Im natural
You a dead man when my gat bust
If you running nigga better run a little faster
These bullets like Heinz oh yeah theyll catch ya
You wanna act tough
Lets see if you really are, when this gun busts
Oh you say you want war, nigga lets go
Bring the drama, thats on my momma
You dont wanna rumble
Jay Rock Ill put you under
(You wanna act tough
Let me see if you really hard, when this gun busts
Oh you say you want war, nigga lets go
Bring the drama, thats on my momma
You dont wanna rumble
K. Dot will put you under)
Lyrics from Snippet
Give it no thought, the people is pressed
The feeling is gone , pull up at the church
Pull up to the bar and look at the— 
Fuck the county , fuck the law
Fuck who doubt me 
 Fuck the leeches, fuck the industry around me 
 Fuck your pro-
-ch
 Vent, vent
 Vent, vеnt
Damn girl looking good in your baby phat
You got an ass a skinny nigga could handle that
Look I aint T-Pain I dont love strippers
I might buy em a drank if that ass thicker
Look I’m a hustler I like to get the cash quicker
And I don’t settle for less I’m not no ass kisser
I’m the ladies man bring your lady friends
I’mma bring my niggas and we can get it in
She like to pop pills, I like to pop steel
And leave a bitch ass nigga with a doctor bill
You fully load ma you don’t need Dr. Phil
I got this Mary Jane shit ease your mind forreal
Lets take a trip to my apartment
Take a lil shot of patron get it started
You fuckin’ with a gangster tonight so say goodbye to the waynester type
You with the Rock
Let me tell y’all something
I seen this bitch right she fine than a motherfucker I ain’t gone lie straight up
I take her home though, fucked and got off, pitbull type
Now do I love them hoes, hell no
Take her to the swap meet before Melrose
Benihana, more like like Top Ramen noodles
Champagne no sweet Kool-Aid made by Sherane
Send her back to her boyfriend with cum stains
I redesign bitches wardrobe
All I do is make up something then sit it between her earlobes
She thinking no one ever invented clothes
Used to hide the camera in the closet
Now I’m like I’m doing you a favor to fuck you bitch pose
They don’t even want to go to award shows
They just wanna award me with hoes
Put em on a track like vocals
Leave em for a day and they want their master back like the first album by Jay
I dash with the dividends no shit if Big Pimpin is a sin then I rather not repent 
Girl on the phone
You know I need my master back like Jay Z first album
Okay I got this one girl her name is tity pop her name is what?
Her name is tiny pop I met her at USC she’s a good girl
This is special, man. As my guy Mozzy say, you know, God up top all the time—real talk, you know. Hip-hop, man. I said hip-hop.
This is a special award because of rap music. This is the thing that got me on the stage. This got me to tour all around the world, support my family and all that. Most importantly it showed me a true definition of what being an artist was.
From the jump I thought it was about the accolades and the cars and the clothes. But it’s really about expressing yourself and putting that paint on the canvas for the world to evolve for the next listener, the next generation after that, you know what I’m saying? Hip-hop has done that for me.
I got a lot of guys in this building right now that I still idolize to this day: Jay-Z, Nas, Puff, you know. These guys showed me the game through their lyrics, from close and from afar.
So with that being said, this trophy to hip-hop, real talk. That’s love, baby. Jay for president!
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin on me?
Jumping on my dick, but this dick aint free
An album for a King, another classic CD
Ghetto lullaby for every one-day MC
Nigga, now R.I.P
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin on me?
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin on me?
This shit another blood, another crip
Gettin shot in they ribs
Over gang warfare, Im gettin dibs
On the WFS motherfucker, make him drink his jizz
Tellin lies about me when Im tryna make it in the biz
Pop open my coke and feel the violеnt fizz
Wagyu got me fatter than motherfuckin Dr. Ryz
Likе Dunford, Im finna pop a kid
I see bag of hash, next thing Im finna place a bid
Lay back, jack off in the crib
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin on me?
Jumping on my dick, but this dick aint free
An album for a King, another classic CD
Ghetto lullaby for every one-day MC
Nigga, now R.I.P
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin on me?
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin on me?
As I lay back, in a Maybach
Or properly pronounced Maybach
Life hurts more than my back
Shout out Sa Vich, my man
Been fuckin with women longer than my mans
I dropped from the skylands
We been gettin high, man
Then we break an iPad
13, motherfucker! I just made a finance
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin on me?
Jumping on my dick, but this dick aint free
An album for a King, another classic CD
Ghetto lullaby for every one-day MC
Nigga, now R.I.P
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin on me?
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin on me?
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy
My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick
Usually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon fill your pockets
Lucy gon move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
Its not so easy when Lucy know you love your Father
Im Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy dont mind, cause at the end of the day youll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucys up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork, I want...
You to know that Lucy got you—all your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that’s possible
I ride shotgun with a shotgun, I ride shotgun with a shotgun
I ride shotgun with a shotgun, Jesus take the wheel 
I ride shotgun with a shotgun, I ride shotgun with a shotgun
I ride shotgun with a shotgun, I ride shotgun with a shotgun
Jesus take the wheel
Yeah
Punch whats happening brother?
Niggas be poppin that shit to me like its something new to me or something, I tell em bout
I tell a nigga quick, that shit just a rerun to me nigga
Ive been doing this shit since vanguard brother
Antonio whats happening with it?
Niggas hatin on me but hop right on my dick soon as they see me
Soon as they see me they be like
What up Dot?
Thats what they tell me every second around the clock
Every time I clock in, rappers checking they watch
Studio paid for, hours unlimited
Assholes, how many MCs I knock off they payroll
How many God MCs I knock off they halo
Hip-hop aint dead, consumers changed up
Rappers love to see gold like the end of a rainbow
I stay low like my socks under my ankles
Play the back like a turtle shell, know well
That my team got me if I ever slack on my shit
So I fail, guess what? I dont even trip
Just like that, crush your little battle raps, punchlines
I did that in 99 you think its a gold mine
When you think of one, you think you hot but I think you done
Like Queens New York slang, look what the killer brung
Machine guns to a fight, fucking right
Pay your bills or Im turning out your lights, good night
I shatter niggas dreams, thinking they the West Coast kings
Till I drop like visine
Tell a nigga quick it aint always what it seems
Like the stitching on swap meet jeans
Im itching to scratch a whack rapper, gun clapper
Snuff him like a rude capper, got a cool bladder, but Im pissed off
At ya
The real is back
Fuck the artificial, wont you let the realers rap
They scribble in they notebooks, me I state facts
Safe estate, they know where the best be at
Whenever I ask, 
Body any nigga that wanna holla my name
And what, no cuts, this is Top Dawg gang
What the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up
Nigga said hed snatch my chain in the streets, what chain?
I barely wear jewelry, so I ever had one
You barely see it on me, and if I ever had a gun
You wouldnt know its on me, so snatch it and then you done
Im in the studio just sipping on Parmesan
Thinking about who could fuck with Kenny and parlor sons
I live this shit, try stop me, you wont live to shit
Probably catch four between your abdomen
Next time you see me, dont ask me who Im collabing with
Between me and you, some of the new West is actresses
New hate activists, lowkey cant stand our shit
But still we continue to drink laxatives
Cold blooded, make the label hand me your budget
This is mine dont touch , did I stutter?
Catch two, cats knew, I been a gorilla, welcome to the zoo
Yup, you little monkeys know what it do
Come test me
The real is back
Fuck the artificial, wont you let the realers rap
They scribble in they notebooks, me I state facts
Safe estate, they know where the best be at
Whenever I ask, 
Body any nigga that wanna holla my name
And what, no cuts, this is Top Dawg gang
What the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up
Dayum, you killin em K-Dizzle
And if you dont kill em then you send em to hospitals
Sleeping on a reclined bed with a thin pillow
Im with a white bitch, ass like a black widow
Bet I jumble to the end of my lifeline
So when I die, you can say I balled for a long time
The 08 Frankenstein, beast like Sasquatch
Feet size thirty-six, steppin on Hip-Hop cause thats my bitch
I write a rhyme, then she ride my dick
The girl is mine, I dont know that hoe that you with
You niggas know this, Im way better than Ive ever been
So focused, like a sniper when he zoom in
Whats your motives? I bet its to go against
Or like the GT get your bitch ass bit, all on these streets
Im the all mighty K, Compton
Rep it till my very death day, let the reaper in his face
And recite every song from N.W.A
I pay homage for those great who paved the way
Wait, back to the subject of whos and who doesnt
Do what I do, bluffin until I touch em
Like a masseuse do, nothing compares to me
But the throne, so tell em bring the chair to me
Im a red bullet, small nigga
But I handle yall niggas like Im eight feet tall
Nigga
Dropped 40 for a Glock 40 thats a hood discount
Thats an accessory gun, sesemy seed buns
For the beef yall brung, yall done fucked up
Fucked with the wrong fuck up
Ive been a nut since pops fucked moms
Fucked up in the head, Im living, but Im brain-dead
Life goes on and you dont need a psychic in order to read my palm
Niggasll get you first where Im from
Thats why I Creep on em, I creep on em, I creep on em
Niggas play cool, put the heat on em
Make the temperature reach the highest peak on em
I said you dont need a pyschic in order to read my palm
I got a bone to pick
I dont want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin in my throne again
Im mad , but I aint stressin
True friends, one question
Bitch, where you when I was walkin?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin
Queen Kunta, everybody wanna and get somethin
Kunta, black man taking no losses
Bitch, where you when I was walkin?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin
Queen Kunta, everybody wanna and get somethin
Kunta, black woman taking no losses
The yam is the power that be
The yam is the power that be 
I got a bone to pick
I dont want you nappy-headed motherfuckers
Sittin in my throne again
Im mad , but I aint stressin
True friends, one question
Bitch, where you when I was walkin?
The yam is the power that be
The yam is the power that be
The yam is the power that be
The yam is the power that be
The yam is the power that be
The yam is the power that be

The yam is the power that be
Im lookin at the flashy lights and wonder - the price and number
Enticed by the glamorous ice, I wanna
Unite with the Hollywood twice, my concert, ll look like yours
And I wanted more than I could ever imagine even a kicked-down door
So you can hear that Im rapping, see, I can hear encore
Struck by the fame bug, been fightin the same drug
The feelin that caned us in vain, its tough love
Please help me, please help me
Im on my knees, please help me, need you to tell me
Aint nothing bigger than you, I thought a Benz would do
But nothin bigger than you, aint nothin bigger than truth
And truth be told, the totem pole
Of non-believers just made the cattle blow
But I can see ya, even when my visions impaired
Youre many moons away, but still youre right here
You won’t find him drinking under tables
Rolling dice or staying out ’til three
You won’t ever find him be unfaithful
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me
You won’t find him tryna change the devil
For money, fame, for power out of greed
You wont ever find him where the rest go
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me
When the money’s spent and all my friends have vanished
And I can’t seem to find no help or love for free
I know that there’s no need for me to panic
Cause I’ll find him, I’ll find him next to me
When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
When all I need’s a hand to stop the tears from falling
I will find him, I’ll find him next to me
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
I will find him, I’ll find him next to me
When the end has come and buildings falling down fast
When we’ve spoilt the land and dried up all the sea
When everyone has lost their heads around us
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me

We Get High
Johnny always lock a nigga down
Knowing damn well we dont wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size, ride like Pac
In his prime, thug life is now on radar
Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscing when the LA Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncles dome
And I dont condone dickriding, Im addicted to
Westsiding, living in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turn me to a lion
Trying, and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city with a nigga, had seen that shit
Compton!, a nigga gotta scream that shit
Never went commercial, never T.V. screened that shit
Cant block or screen that shit, now everybody sing that shit
Smoking, choking, always rollin something
I dont need a key to start my car bitch, I just push a button
Did a show and got a half a mill and spent it like its nothing
Money flowing, never sober
Smoking till I got concussions, no discussions
Man I got a condo and got a big crib
Pounds all over my kitchen is
If I aint on the road gettin it
Then Im in the hood where my niggas live
Did a tour, sold it out, just bought a pound bout to finish it
Now all my pasta got shrimp in it
You talk about and Im living it
Fucking little bitch
I cant be faded
Im the nigga from the motherfucking
I cant be faded
Im the nigga from the motherfucking street
Its so much drama in the bottom of Watts
Kinda hard bein jay motherfuckin rock
Gains cop from bitch niggas that wanna see me flop
It aint happening captain wait till my album drop
More money, more hoes, of course more haters
When you see, they gon hate you
I cant be faded, cant be seen
Yea the thangs a blow
Til your head, lord knows where your brains will go
Trigger finger itchy
Rollin with killas that leave a 6 in your wig piece
Going against me thats blasphemy
Im a blood, got crips thatll blast for me
Nigga you know my gang, its tighter than blood nigga
I got some because im hot like a slug nigga
Walk up in the club with the slug, chained a bitch
Flexed up then, them thangs will spit nigga
You better duck when I aim the shit
I cant be faded, I am the shit
Jay Rock
I cant be faded
Im the nigga from the motherfucking
I cant be faded
Im the nigga from the motherfucking street
Went from flipping monkey on bars
Gang-banging, caine slanging now Im chilling with stars
Grew apart, got the hood on my back
From L.A to the bay, West Coast we bringing it back
Make way, I got the base in the trunk of my car
Middle finger to laws
All I gotta say is fuck em all
I blaze a pound for them niggas behind bar
Free my nigga Poodamey
Homie just stand tall
My nigga two ts the bitch killer
Im Jay motherfucking Rock you can call me the snitch killer
Them bitch niggas think they got big balls
Come test the board, get smoked like the menthol
Im more 55 on tracks of heavy weight
I got gats that make your ass levitate
I got raps thatll make your ass stutter me
I got tapped how your bitch loving me
I cant be faded, thats why Im the most hated
Im the motherfucking hoes favorite
I cant be faded
Im the nigga from the motherfucking
I cant be faded
Im the nigga from the motherfucking street
Welcome to the story of my life, Miseducation of Kendrick
Stressin, Hennessy shots, throw em back like its vintage
Wondering can I live? Where is the generosity?
Something just gotta give, tryna stay positive
My mode is to be a mogul
Searching for a dollar without compromising my vocals
Really Im just a noble
Kid from the west side of Compton
My cousins was selling crack, while I played Sonic
You say that you grinding, you niggas is full of shit
And might need a Heimlich
Maneuver to throw up what you consume
My shine is bright enough to make a dead flower bloom
In a room full of curtains
Im for certain that Im certainly popping a pistol verbally
And never will I get shot, ya aim is all fucked up
As if a Sidekick dropped
Im nice wit it, bro-bro
My peeps depending on me, we be where the stove go
Lets eat
British lay em down, thanks for the fuckin bank
William Wallace Malatov blonde shank to sprank
You cold in the D well Im like Frank and Dank
But when the whiskeys all free ima break the tank
I speak an amazing maze
To make a mason maybe need a matron
Hey, my sonics bless ya drums like a patron saint
In Section 80 they all talking like you reppin crazy
Blood Type O positively, yeah my records rabies
Been there, done that, aint got the scars to match
Beware, these boys shoot flares and pull masks
Got gas, spread the mustard on the custard
Vanilla muthafuckers up and droppin by the numbers
She jackin up my lumber, I aint even say I love her
Piss blood on these bitches tryna keep me ground under
Hunger games with lames, now I drive in my own lane
Ever since supporters started tatting the frames, MAYDAY
YEAH...yo
So many try to Dr. Jekyll and hide
And try to cover the side
That I could show you in pride
They try smoking the line, then try sniffin the joint
If rap is about the money these niggas missin the point
I cant, stand bias from people who never stand by us
I got a feeling for killing innocent stand-byers
I give a fuck if we could float ya boat
Its Blood Type, nigga cut ya throat
Im done, BAH....Chiefer
I said be grateful and give some thanks
And he said man, for what?
I been outta my luck cuz I been stuck
And plus Im broke as fuck
So shut up and pack it up or take it elsewhere
Get a nigga off this welfare, with some healthcare
Can you help there?
He thought he deserved and had the nerve to kick the blame to me
But strange to see how it came to be
This game just aint the same to me
And I aint gon sympathize or look in his eyes
And tell no lies
So I said FUCK WHAT YOU HEARD
THE TRUTH BURNS, BETTER RECOGNIZE
We have yet to see....
Where these roads will lead
So we take what we want
And give thanks when we receive
We have yet to see
Tomorrow may not be
So we take what we want
And give thanks when we receive
Yo like I was sayin though, I pull up to the chick house
Nigga be like straight cartoon characters 
No doubt, tasmanian devil
Aye, aye, aye man, aye

Tell these- tell these fools
Im tellin em
These Cali ass niggas
Cali, Bali
We go to valleys
Damn industry niggas
Its still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though Ive grown a lot, cant keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that Im known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when Im on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga?
My last album was The Chronic
They want to know if he still got it
They say raps changed
They wanna know how I feel about it
Its Alive
Still puffing my leafs
Still fuck with the beats, still not loving police
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets, repping 213
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left aint too much changed
Now I done grew up round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That Imma get fucked up, fillin up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me
I rap with a Pyrex
In the projects
Im crack in a pot
Im a prospect
Im a pirate
On a dock full of dope
I can dissect any rapper
You could vote for the Lochness
You can not test no key in a Tesla
Bitch, I ride like a freight train parked outside
And my young niggas came with the extras, ah

They knew he was West Coast when he walked thru the door
In all gangbang attire bodies parked on the floor
Rag in his back pocket, nigga, dare him to trip
Faded and associated with the Bloods and Crips
Ask questions if you want to, two to ya dome
I stay making donations to the funeral home
I gotta aim like a marksman, bet he leave crawlin
Afghanistan spitters on anything walkin
Nigga known to keep the burner with some extra shots
I let my mothafuckin tech play connect the dots
Same whores and gang wars, time to settle the score
Hit em all with the black talons, leave em dead on the floor
You fucking with psycho, like no other
With a nine in my pocket and the mind of a hustler
Certified riders, Comp-towns finest
You should rewind this, warhoggz behind this

I dont wanna pop pistols, have something hot hit you
Plus Im running from the feds, got kids in block issues
What you gon do when yo homies is not with you?
Cut out yo eyes, mail em to yo moms in box tissue
You are not official, I dont do it less its beneficial
Vinnie gonna have to let the semi whistle
Have that ass on the ten oclock news
Dont get killed for tryna pay dues
Stay sinning, always be winning while they lose
Roll Benzs, fucking these women off Grey Goose
Close your curtains, disconnect your mind
Youre soul searching, you talk shit but you wont hurt him
Let the fo burn him, so the next time you speak up on me
You gon feel it up in your sternum
I will never leave, thats just how it is so let it be
Before I have to hit you with the Desert Eag
I rip the melody, and flip a set of keys
I guess its meant to be to have me sailing on the seven seas

Al Bundy cause my other hand is gripping my dick, aint nothing funny, bitch
Monopolize my prophecy, they watching me thru binoculars
Obviously, bitch, Im Pac in these Wallabees
Wanna-bes wanna be me, take one of these then take it easy
The Lord wants you and Forbes list need me
Lord forgive me for my ways, I blame it on how I was raised
Inside of a cage, praying with slaves
Compton, California, the coroner work for seven days
Throughout the week, you might as well leap yourself to a grave
Lunges out a bottomless pit, bottles of Hennessy
Guzzle another fifth, pop a pill then pop in the clip
Pop a shot then circle the block, then you just repeat it again
Ammo, reincarnated, Rambo, now tell a friend, motherfucker

To the fullest, Ima get it to the core
And they tape pictures, yellow tape, stretched out, inches

Shoe string, choke em up, let em get no breather
No pressure, black and white, the skies

The .22 fit right between my bitch thighs
If you blink once, it be pointing right between your eyes
You better off tryna plan your own suicide
Cause its nothing, but torture if you want you to die
The 745 got weed in it, riding with the .45, times two the speed limit
I pop eyes for a that spinach
Cut em down to the white meat, have em no skinnin

So any given time they can grace you

Before I spazz and squirt and I’m out that...bitch
Broadcasting live from south central Los Angeles
Where the babies born scandalous
The street I keep my hand in it
The gun I keep my hand on it
Niggas is going to need bandages
If I brandish it ambulances, the chance you make it slim nigga
I’m good in the hood cause I motivated them niggas
I graduated from dumb hoes and mault liquor
To expensive wine and dime bitches
Red lining the DB9 like it’s my time pimping
Audemar quality time spending
And you niggas is borderline bitches
That’s my opinion
And my niggas is ride or die Aftermath my religion
Talk out but I don’t listen
Act out and come up missing

And I’m so west coast, ok corral with it
My new foreign car cant pronounce that shit

Run you dick suckers, keep me out that bitch
Before I spazz and squirt and I’m out that...bitch
Broadcasting live from Compton California where foreigners never come
Mothers are worrisome and we dislike the governor
I hope these angels can cover us
If the LAPD ain’t doing it then it was a cover up
Coroners about to cover up everybody
I’m serious, every shotty is sawd off
And every nigga is militant
And your gut like...What?
EBT Cards, no credit cant ease cards
All my life beed OG aw now my life on the billboard soon
Give me room, I react like a wildebeest and
Throw salt inside your wound your just diabetes to me
Aint shit sweet with these hotels homie
That crip shit got my uncle’s life in jail ho
So if I put the same line, theyll never forgive me
Or worse than that the niggas right around the corner might kill me
I’m fighting back when it’s hard what
No barber my guards up, the author of fallen fathers that did it without much, this my house nigga
Whose house is this? Money out the … can’t count that shit
Stacking death prez, mouth to mouth that shit
When they said a nigga wouldnt amount to shit
Now whose house is this? Laughing so hard my tongue is out and shit
Run you dick suckers, keep me out that bitch
Before I spazz and squirt and I’m out that...bitch
From the very heart of me
Belief becomes action
And no distractions will take my eyes off the prize
Greatness is my goal
But theres failure on the way
Full of insecurity, self-hate and doubt
But what I cant control cant confine me
And what I cant do cant stop me
This is how I express myself
Not how I follow others expectations
But how I stay true
How Long you been Banging?
I been banging sense 85
On the real this shit aint no gimmick
Or no game my nigga! this hit is real live
Thruthful type shit my nigga!
You know what im saying?
On the real my nigga!
And I lost a lot of real niggas to this hit
Yeah...Coughs
You can smell marijuana in every corna
From South Central to Arizona
You heard the state, the murder rate
The killer cali-California
Cops get caught outside the Compton court
By cold killers like they caught Pneumonia
See the 90s was like Pulp fiction
Jerry curl juice drippin
On 45s when we dumpin on ya
Grew up in the slums were we glorify guns
& Gain respect by jumpin on corners
& Dumping at you, cops just jump in action
Trigger happy but nobodys gun is smiling
When somebodys son is dying
911 thats who you dialing?
Ku Klux Klan that who you dialing?
Killers wear blue and move in silence
Hear the sirens? Scatter in disarray
My blocks been hotter than dinner plates
We got beef like a foreman
You laying dormant at your wake
Real superheroes end in coffins with no capes
Me & Kendrick Top Dawg, Dogg Pound, Future rich Shit
Picture that with no Instagram, bullet to your temple
You better pray that my pistol jams
Yeah!
Kill kill kill, murder murder murder 8x
Killa cali you can try you can die motherfucker!
Killa cali you can try you can die motherfucker!
Compton Shit! Yeah! Dope Boy I fuck with you nigga!
Uh, fuck em all, kill em all off
Sent em off to the Holy One
Put a hole in one like miniature golf
You doubled your profit?
Well I see triple like Ricky Ross
Hand over the cloth, cloth over gun
Gun over your jaw, bullet over your tongue
Stick my dick inside hip hop and shorty sprung
Every time I get a chance to cum over I overcome
Over the snare drum
Say who fucking with you if you the God MC?
I tell em nun! Get it? I tell em Nun
Catholic nor a Christian, holding the book of sums
In back of my true religions
From the murder capitol niggas cap at your neighbors
And never tell you who did it
Aiming for your grill like a dentist working on British
Teeth if you speak get shot in the mouth bitches
Its like that sent shots at a crip or a blood or an Essay
Bet they coming right back....RIGHT?
Bitch! uh west Scoe Gotti Yeah
Gun shots wake me up from a light slumber
Another murder what I see when I open my shutters
We from the gutter no bread and butter just lead and water
Either you bite the bullet or you can die from the hunger
The suns getting lower, the corners getting darker
Guns getting loaded to slaughter our sons and daughters
Its time to get smarter cause times getting harder
Every second the unemployment line is getting longer
Baby crying and mama she dont know what to do!
I know its tragic but in the projects its nothing new
Im just kicking it luxury cliquing it
Watching the news the shits fucking ridiculous
Roll a cigar cup full of codeine
Cash in a rubber band pistol in my other hand
Killa cali this the realist state most expensive real estate
Benz with the dealer plates !
Come on… She wanna roll…
Catch me in the cut with a cup of the juice
I’m chilling, believe this, I’m Jesus to women
They all want to jump in my coupe like a pigeon
Smokey on Friday, find me on the highway
Middle finger up, not giving a fuck
Like a nun who masturbates, congratulate
The in my bathub
See, my style is a cast of
Goldie Mack, super fly, Bumpy Johnson
Holding my Johnson when you jump on my dick
Because haters always like to jump in the mix
Say they can dress but always throwing a fit
They must know I got cream when I’m pushing the whip
That’s whip cream, use your common sense when listening
I strike gold when I roll like a pirate
Soulo won’t you call T-Mobile and play the sidekick
I’m number one…
And you ain’t gotta say my name is on point cuz…
And you ain’t gotta say my game is on point cuz
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ain’t gotta say my game is on point cuz
And you ain’t gotta say my name is on point cuz..
My game on point like fingers in the courtroom
But I ain’t snitching, I’m just winning
I’m just twisting high with the flyest women
Lay ‘em down in my project building
They catch feelings like root canals
I boot ‘em out when they talk about lovey-dovey
Shut up and fuck me, low key with my broads
Make sure they never cross paths
Cuz if they ever do it’d be all bad
I play the role like Samuel L
Tell the hoes what they really wanna hear like
You my boo, you my baby, you my number one
Drop it off in the drop then tell another one
And you ain’t gotta say my name is on point cuz…
And you ain’t gotta say my game is on point cuz
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ain’t gotta say my game is on point cuz
And you ain’t gotta say my name is on point cuz..
Ab-Soul, what you gonna tell me, I ain’t trying to see the grave
I’m just trying to get fresh to death
I’m in the club with a mean two-step, like the sisters to Cinderella
The clock strikes midnight
I’m still in the spotlight like a lab rat, bad back spazzing out
Sip henny until I pass out, or mash out like a sack of potatoes
Looking for a good girl gone bad from Barbados
To bring to the pad
Not for the mouse, but to the house, calling a cab and I’m kicking ‘em out
Nah, I don’t run it like Chris Brown do
But I can make a tune you can sip Krystal to
My game on point cuz my aim is sharp, even when it’s dark
Travis Bark, famous star, rider
But don’t blame the car, I’m an eye’s desire
You would go blind sizing up my attire
And you ain’t gotta say your boy is that hot cuz I know I’m that hot
Like arguing with a narc with rocks in my socks
I walked in the door, she said “Who are you?”
I said SOOOUUUL

Mama, dear, spare your feelings
Im relivin moments, peeling more residual
 buy the building, burn the building
Take your bitch, rebuild the building just to fuck some more
 justify my love for you
And touch the sky for God to stop, debating war
Put the pussy on a pedestal 
Put the pussy on a high horse
That pussy to die for
That pussy to die for
Peter, piper, picked a pepper
So I could pick your brain and put your heart together
We depart the shady parts and party hard
The diamonds yours, the coupe forever
My best shots might shoot forever like 
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried bout those comments

What up though?
We the best music
Oh, I guess Im on my Don shit
What that mean?
Ima go, aaaa
DJ Khaled
Straight up, late nights mixed with early days
Itll probably be that way until the pearly gates 
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man 
Least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested 
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy its never going south less we down in South Beach 
Khaled on the jet skis, preaching what you believe in 
Everything fast cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know its true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way Ima take it
Just like its fuckin taxes
You made it up while we made it happen
I kill shit to just kill time, no chill time
In the field on time every time like its drill time
I took a break from my girl so she still fine
Took a break from the game, but its still mine
Got my big break, now we tryna break the records
These niggas couldnt take the pressure that I ate for breakfast
Pretty girls showin love like Im David Beckham
The takeover will only take a second, straight up
And Ima celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldnt break me, now its all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And Ima celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldnt break me, now its all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust 
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust 
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I dont wear crosses no more, Yeshuas coming back
I aint scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I dont resonate with the concept of love and hate
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said Fuck Mother Earth, thats PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifers spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my familys in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubiks cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches
Sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your bosss employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Two new Royces with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason
You wont die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, dont you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it
Lets play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
Im restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I dont like to sleep, Im up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, Im off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix
And Ima celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldnt break me, now its all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And Ima celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldnt break me, now its all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
Holy, holy key, holy
All those days and all that stays in
I dont keep it, I wont be here for it
All those days and all that stays in
I dont keep it though, I wont be here for it
Blood on my hands and it look like candy
How I pay-pay lawyers, and nobody cant stand me
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
I got blood on my hands and it look like candy
How I pay-pay lawyers, and nobody cant stand me
Yeah-yeah 
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
This what kings do, talk paper and skate
You know what this what kings do, lay up and stack in the gate
This what kings do, throw family first its real
This what kings do, think about flyin a Persian, yup
This what kings do, vacate lands in Egypt
This what kings do, breakdown plans with speeches
This what kings do, make sure mamma is right, yup
This what kings do, hit Dubai in a night
And this how kings move, yo, hold your money and invest wise
Whether you sellin buttons, or select pies
A king move, keep it silent, no one else dies
We all Pharaohs and Cameros, flexin S5s
Its what a king do
This how a king move
Blood on my hands and it look like candy
How I pay-pay lawyers, and nobody cant stand me
Yeah-yeah

Yeah-yeah 
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Pardon my Bohemian ways
I know I act like I be stuck in a Bohemian daze
You said you love me, so dont rush me
Love is patient and now you gotta trust me
To take form, like the canvas of the Grand Canyon
Product of a beautiful storm or an unborn
Carried just below the heart
Quietly preparing for his start
Let me Michelangelo my Sistine Chapel
You know they say Rome wasnt built in a day
And diamonds need a while before they hit the display
So I guess I see myself in a similar way
Im paced, like my momma in the kitchen whipping
Always mixing up and fixing
Begged her for a taste and she said it wasnt ready
She stir it up slow and she cook it up steady
This is not a race track, living in the ASAP
Im just trying to do it justice when it play back
Sometimes I gotta stall the BPM
So I can weave these dreams and polish up these gems
In the end, I got love for the show biz
But sometimes you gotta stop and smell the roses
Keeping up with the Kardashians and Joneses
Nah, I take my time and compose this
They say greatness get better with time
They say concrete roses hard to find
Sit inside my room, and let these thoughts bloom
Its a secret garden in my mind
Flower child
Okay, buffering, creativity suffering
When you bustlin hustlin for the numbers and
You missed the journey if you climbed too fast
The beauty of the struggle when it comes to pass
Amateurs swear they need a balancer
I want that legendary like excalibur
Chasing calibers liberated as a bachelor
Traveler, never falling victim to these calendars
Rough draft after rough draft
No staff, perfecting on my abstract craft
And now they calling me celebrity
Only thing I give a damn about is my integrity
They play the game like checkers when Im talking bout chess
Tryna do more when Im talking bout less, I stress
Quantity aint always quality
So let me formulate my prophecy
When the lights get low and you notice I am the sun
The winter time was snow but only little you know
I will still breathe, give me the keys
Im resuscitating the game, see me in CPR
My name is a gun cocked, gun shot
Dead and I wont stop
Gun cocked, gun shot
Head in a pine box
With a dozen roses, hold this with a gift card
Gun cocked, gun shot
Flowers on your mommas yard
They say greatness gets better with time
So why expedite my prime?
See Im just a lilac tied to the earth
Exuding the fragrance of light and birth
So respect my photosynthesis
My petals, my stems, full of nourishing flow
You thought this was a love song, but no
I just need you to let me grow
Pour up , head shot

Dont you, wont you, be our new friend?
Then make these walls spin
Tell me youre all in
Nigga, why you babysittin only two or three shots?
Ima show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, Ima dive in it
Pour up , head shot 
Sit down , stand up 
Pass out , wake up 
Faded , faded
Now these niggas dont want me to win
I guess I just gotta talk my shit then
Aye
 like Top Ramen is spread from the bounty
This hunter is aiming straight at your head, niggas doubt me
Tell em they better count me in, like Dracula
Packing a black mack in the back of a magnum
You rappers is gon go
Thats one hell of a punch line but lets get back to the flow
Left jab hit your nose
Right hook fracture your skull
Your body is free
Put luxury tax on your soul 
Thats what they yelling when Im pulling up
Like a rough rider working out in the hood and stuff
They say I aint in the hood enough?
Bitch Im a transmission
The pump leak when your oil slipping
And I been in the kitchen, like a toaster
With them toasters, hang you like a Willie Lynch poster
East side vulture, preying on your dead caracas
Sorry I was starving
Niggas out here dont want me to win
So I talk my shit again and again
Imma talk my shit
Imma talk my shit
They say I aint got what it takes to win
So I talk my shit again and again
Imma talk my shit
Imma talk my shit
Imma talk my shit cause I made
Every stripe that it takes
To be able to write what I say
The beat made you hype for the day
The beat made me write with a sway
Me and Jay bring the night to the day
And bring the night to the page
As far as bars go
Literally up there fam I call the stars home
Im by far past far from the forlorn
I leave this bar open unless you log on
Figure that part out
Wikipedia that
I Wikipedia whack and look up your stats
More fuckers start hiding when they get on the track
They ducking behind the snare like I aint divvying that
And if you speaking of the speaker
Im the speaker that the speakers applaud for
Speaker that the speakers turn on for
Im leaking through the speakers on all yall
My short term speaking is long haul
Your speaking is all gone
Niggas out here dont want me to win
So I talk my shit again and again
Imma talk my shit
Imma talk my shit
They say I aint got what it takes to win
So I talk my shit again and again
Imma talk my shit
Imma talk my shit
Straight from the Pyrex pot
Im a crack rock wait
Grab the A1 sauce lets raise the stakes
Catastrophic K.Dot
Currently stacking currency
Bet I make profits like Im God
Every instrumental get dealt with
Burnt and melted
Jump in the water
Jaws is ready to eat you selfish
Im cold hearted
Thats for sure
Talk shit like a nigga farted
But the smell came out the other hole
Hol up, big truck
Lurking the premises
Pull up, hoes rubbing they clitoris
What the fuck?
This is K.Dot, they pray I
Fall like a jump shot
From they favorite player
With seconds on the clock
Im here to souffle ya
Turn rappers into
Anything barbecued
Theyre miniature party food
I get spizzy
Like Im Hugh Hef Come fuck with me
One first tonight
Might change your life, right?
Yeah
Imma talk my shit
09 is mine nigga
Aint no stopping me homeboy

Get with it or get lost
Roll with it or get rolled the motherfuck over nigga
Skyzoo wassup my nigga
K.Dot whats happening brother
Top Dawg Entertainment nigga
Get with it or get lost motherfuckers
Aint no stopping us nigga
Yeah
Lyrics from Snippet
 fuck up the vibe
 go through my phone, you make me lie
We only look better when we dont got to try
Girl you look better when you dont got to try
Real niggas still in style
Real women still in style
Fake hoes out of style...
Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Now we got problems
And I dont think we can solve them
So take a look at what youve done
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
And now its all rusted
Did you have to hurt me when Im weak?
Baby, I couldnt breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like youre laughing right at me
Oh, its so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Now we got problems
And I dont think we can solve them
So take a look at what youve done
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Did you think wed be fine?
I dont think I want you back in my life
So dont think its in the past
These kinda wounds they last and they last
Now did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this wont
So if youre coming my way
Just dont
Oh, its so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Now we got problems
And I dont think we can solve them
So take a look at what youve done
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Band-aids dont fix dont you know
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts 
Mhmm
If you love like that, blood runs cold!
Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love 
So take a look what youve done
Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Now we got problems
And I dont think we can solve them 
So take a look at what youve done
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Fair warning, people would have never had a problem
If the naysayers or the doubters would have got him
Slumped in the corner, for sure Im a goner
Shoot with no aim, so them niggas couldnt spot him
Now I got a question, if I really even want it
When this shit is like a trip through the city of Sodom
Gomorrah, the horror, stories are endless
Workshop, working all night, no apprentice
Funny when a nigga speak truth he a menace
Ushered in the underground, lifelong sentence
Theres where I dwell, aint no need to cry for me
Rapper gonna eat, and I eat well
Its been six years since I stepped out the shell
Talent on the rise to the top, I propel
Big Dho set sail, your boy gon win
Bet niggas act crazy when they see us again
Im really going in, Ive been had nothing to lose
So I choose to take yall through a spin
A journey through the mind of a sane ass artist
If you spitting blah-blah shit, you a target
If you spitting blah-blah shit, then just forfeit
What go around come around, now they all on my dick
Kendrick Lamar, Im bout to get my mop stick
Niggas bump their gums, and their bitches be bumping my shit
I fry your optics, if you watching my style, watch it
Tyrannosaurus reading thesaurus, hold rappers hostage
Catastrophic, its 9-11 when Im repping
Skip college to fly first class, learn a lesson
Straight brutal, roman numerals
Number one eating Ramen noodles, rhyming crucial under the sun
Kudos to the most high, which is me
I probably make em plan their suicide, so usually
I aint never been with the shit starting, but yall done started some shit
Im bout to drink some ex-lax then commence
To returning the favor to all of my neighbors and comrades
Calm down, you more like Trina than Trinidad, lets box now
Throw your dukes up
Pussy probably holding Daisy Dukes and C-cups
I look inside this industry and I dont see much
I just see lunch, and your shit thats more bore like tourists
Im laid back, my feet up, how cool is that?
The twenty-ten Kool G. Rap, whenever I rap
I got my arsenal strapped on my back, Im ready for war
They tend to look for me when they fiend for Afeni Shakur
Conversing, not hibernating, under the planet core
At thirteen I cancelled PG-13 and went for gore
Thats what I pledge
Its profound that Im underground touching mainstreams like river beds
Yeah, they saying he a breath of fresh air 
They cant smell all this weed that I brought in here
Black & Mild smoke still linger on my clothes
So unprofessional, I shouldnt be meeting with millionaires
Pull up a chair, Ill school you to it
I was a student truant that never studied, just always knew it
You just new to it, with no clue on how you should do it
Like youth in junior high school when pubertys blooming
And mind you, I never mined you, I aint digging for gold
Honestly, I just want to stick my dick in some hoes
Kick a flow, hit the dro with my bros
Tippy-toe in this rap game, make a lil name
With this lil lane Ive been paving since I was a teen
That I never really thought that I would attain
When Big Pooh dropped Sleepers I could barely get a feature
They aint know this regular nigga would be the future
Ive viewed the roof from the floor, Ive been here before
Im finna blow a couple of times over like two tubas
And Im a still want more with this appetite
Till the critics stop giving me mixed signals like traffic lights
You know? The lavish life, but for now Im the new Kunta
A slave to my rhyme book, a line of mine, your times up
The bastard kissing your bitch with the blackish soup coolers
Shell testify, excuse Judas when Im crucified
I dont need the hype
They call me- fuck it- I dont need no introduction
No ad-libing my name 100 times for nothing
You already know its K. Dot, city of Compton
Analogy is like Biggie and Bed Stuy, Oakland and 2Pac
Im more focused, Im nothing like you new guys
Struggling over a few lines thinking you hot
Cause your homey said you you was a few times
Which is too many times
They lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hrs, you niggas better get your bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key, my cool is on, she love my A/C
My juice is on, and I wish one of yall try to rob me
I shoot, and have you laying between the sheets with the eyes leased 
I push the coupe like a high speed
The helicopters come and realize that nothings behind me is behind me
Your honor, I fuck over this beat with no condom
This aint rap its really a porno, re-wind me back
Finally the finest of em all is back
To define the laws of crack, yall dont obey
Yall aint nice, yall just OK
Youre nothing more than a little John phrase
Im Mike Jordan in his prime, modern day Issac Hayes
Theme song to Shaft, equivalent to the theme song to your career
Study my craft, you ignorant, I do it without a pen and pad
Just inspiration: something you never had
If my pockets is something you trying to grab
I pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab
You old news, you old dudes get out of my way
Let the young boy come through; dont mention my age
Im on a mission for pay, and you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
But actually you aint accurate fucking with the music biz
The industry like, Fuck it, let the music be his
No theme park, Im not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water
Do he really fuck with President Carter?
My reply is that I cant stay away from the bosses
Got the bidding war popping like an auction
5 or 10 labels like what he hitting for? 7 zeros or more?
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my door
Money in front of me, couldnt open the door
Boom! Thats that, left him on his back flat
You talking like that, jack, spitting
About crack, but never been about that
Im real with this rap, Im just speaking the facts
Rap, but some niggas wack, talent something they lack
So gather your whole pack, Im taking them off the map
My pockets is getting fat, their pockets, they staying flat
So imma just hollaback, they rocking their tiny Js
But niggas aint getting paid in the spot, like they a slave
12 hours just for some change, man this shit a shame
When the feds come, who you gon blame? But thats just
Learning the game, you niggas should do the same
They go as fast as they came, cause passing me you aint gon see
I go bar for bar, and b, you are just a target, b
So just call me Muhammed Ali
Easy shit be hard to do, easy for me and hard for you
Im leaving you with the , pick up a broad, bout three or two
Life is like a puzzle but my level is some trouble, man, you gotta use your muscle, in the hood I had to tussle
Man, Im moving to the shop, , man youre not
Niggas steady talking but barely looking in the spot
Im so far ahead of my time, I got people 5 years from now pressing rewind
Im hardly a friend with yall, i hate rappers, where is your artist at?
If it aint a good picture youre draw, dont bring it to the architect
Often you arguing bout who got next, claiming youre running the game
Niggas are barely walking yet, hopping all over beats without studying training camp
Try studying a few greats then maybe youll be where im at
Your songwriting aint great, your mixtapes mediocre
You recycle the same quotes, youre not switching the flow
Your flow in the same place, just dont rap; elaborate
Try to expand, try to be more creative perhaps
My rap friends, i aint saying youre wack, psyche
Like an in-voice, Im just stating the facts, right?
 metaphores i write, in fact, its been a factor
Youve feared your whole life, no TV show
Dont compare me with them, thats like a shark versus Nemo, a gorilla to a chimp, Jordan versus Kukoč
A Tony Montana with blow on his nose to a Nino
All those days in, all that stays in
I dont keep it, I wont be here for it
All those days in, all that stays in
I dont keep it though, I wont be here for it
Blood on my hands and it look like candy
I pay-ay lawyers and the mic cant stand me
Ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah
I got lood on my hands and it look like candy
I pay-ay lawyers and the mic cant stand me
Ya-yah, turn me up, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah
Ya-yah, ya-yah
This what kings do, talk paper and skate
You know what this what kings do, lay up and stack in the gate
This what kings do, throw family first, its real
This what kings do, thinkin about flying the up
This what kings do, vacay lands in Egypt
This what kings do, rake down plans with speeches
This what kings do, make sure mama is right, yup
This what kings do, hit Dubai in a night
And this how kings move, yo, hoe your money and invest wise
Whether you selling buttons or select pies
A king move, keep it silent, no one else dies
We all pharaohs in Camaros flexin S5s 
Its what kings do, this how a king move 
Yo, yo, yo, yo, ayo
Blood on my hands and it look like candy
I pay-ay lawyers and the mic cant stand me
Ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah
I got lood on my hands and it look like candy
I pay-ay lawyers and the mic cant stand me
Ya-yah, turn me up, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah
Ya-yah, ya-yah

And every time I go out, yeah
I hear it from this one, I hear it from that one
That you got someone new

Even in my head youre still in my bed
Maybe Im just a fool
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that Im not around?
My friends are actin strange, they dont bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
I dont wanna know

Wasted 
And the more I drink the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I cant take it
Do you think that I should just go on without ya?
I dont wanna know, know, know, know
Whos taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no

Whos taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I dont wanna know
Money over bitches why you bullshiting nigga
Listen pull up in something with the roof missing
You dissing four-five thatll leave your roof missing
Who tripping true spitting cadillac coupe dipping
Crew whippin wit yo bitch present this is new pimpin
Roll up get a cup only Hennessy sippin
West Coast jumpin like a low-low
Three-wheelin we feelin
Like the New Dynasty dominating the Nation
Pamona pimpin when im sippin that hard liquor
Hit the studio with mo cuts than a cold sensor
Nigga what, im a west coast predator
Pteradactyl when i sink my teeth in the beat
Got a lock like Armostol? shakles around her feet
Glock in my right palm got my strong arm steady like kwali
Make it hard for you to get by the silencer is so serene
Sound like a california ocean breeze, no lie
So high really though put hoes on video
Run trains like blue lines on Subways
While you save em like coupons we throw away
Extra large Magnum wrappers
We them nasty rappers
We them Magnum blasters
Say hello to the pastor
Coughin up a loogie when Im walking past your casket
See I dont give a shit about my enemies
Feel the same way about a bitch
Speaking of a bitch these hoes is no joke
Tell a story any chance they get
Where my money at? She talking bout she broke
Now I can dig in her left pocket
Dig in her right pocket, dig in her back pocket
Pull money out of all three and still swear up and down that she dont got it
Bitch, you must think Im the fool
You better hop up on the track and put that pussy to use
Now, I oughta go upside your motherfucking wig
But you lucky your little boy called the police on me the last time I hit you
In front of yo kid
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you aint up on this
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you aint up on this
Okay, headed to that swap meat
Coppin all that Avalon
Fresh white Ts and some Js what I had in mind
I remember days when a nigga didnt have a dime
Now I got big dollas, I just buy whatever come to mind
Choppas squeezed, I remember when I used to window shop
Now I hit the mall, buy it all cus Im on the top
Boss like I used to dream of this moment
Used to roll that stress, now I roll that kill, I call it coma
Step inside my ride, I know you smell the aroma
6-50 top back, chillin on my corner
Used to be MacDonalds, now we eat at Benihanas
5 star suites with freaks, thats on my mama
They tell me money evil but it wash away my problems
Dont matter what the price, lil mama just know I got it
Aw, it aint trickin if you got it
My bank account solid and my wallet need a diet
I used to be broke but now Im ballin, Im ballin
Used to be broke but now Im ballin, Im ballin
Used to be broke but now Im ballin, Im ballin
Used to be broke but now Im ballin, Im ballin
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you aint up on this
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you aint up on this
Like my nigga meet me outside
These homies rush me just so they can steal my flashdrive
My music that important, imported in iPod
Buying my CDs like payin ties, act God
Im sure success will taste better than nectarines
Growing in the spring, baskets the fruit of life
Had the boy arrange me every time I pick up the mike
I hop my entertainment be a bigger impact than Mike
Can I live like the princess of Munda?
Got a princess to groom the lacks o my scalp with a golden comb
And Im on, Cloud 9, stopping acts like in the sky
Im from Compton, cant you hear me coming like Im from the shy
Im inspired from a magic twice, which art is a rep and run?
But if they knew my intentions the reff and probably run
Im just a good kid from the city who made straight As
Tryna make the transition from Rose to Kool Aid
I used to be broke but now Im ballin, Im ballin
Used to be broke but now Im ballin, Im ballin
Used to be broke but now Im ballin, Im ballin
Used to be broke but now Im ballin, Im ballin
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you aint up on this
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you aint up on this
Okay, started as a youngin, now Im at the top
Used to ride the city bus, now Im at the car lot
And we live up in the mall now, something like a regular
I ball every day like clap, I got my cheddar up
I used to smoke dirt weed, now Im smoking better
But in school I couldnt get a girl but now Im getting groupie love
Now Im seeing better days, mamas so proud of me
Do it for my grandma but I know she lookin down on me
Reach in my pocket and grab big bills
If this is Caribbean rich I like how this feel
Hah, and aint nobody help me get here
If you lookin for me at the top is where Ill be, Ill be there go
I used to be broke but now Im ballin, Im ballin
Used to be broke but now Im ballin, Im ballin
Used to be broke but now Im ballin, Im ballin
Used to be broke but now Im ballin, Im ballin
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you aint up on this
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you aint up on this
Ive been known to flip on niggas, spaz on bitches
One state of mind, Im out for the riches
Ive seen good crack, uncle stuck in the kitchen
Now behind prison, phone calls cant visit
Seventeen, half of my life has been explicit
Rated R content, no supervision
With you talking nonsense, Im not trynna listen
Im a point guard, small forward, play your position
Before you wind up in the lake with the fishes
On a blind date with a crocodile, vicious
I switch the flow so you say that I sound different
But the flow is the same reason my dick kill bitch kissing??
And thats the same reason your not in my competition
Cause I swear right now that none of yall existing
Fall off is probably what you wishing
But I cant stop, wont stop, young gunning you niggas
Ive been known to have stash for the burnnin
And break a bitch down to the point that I learn them
And when I get dough, Imma let you know, throw the cake in your face like Ike Turner
I turn a schoolgirl into a dick smuggler, sex publisher, rated X government
See me in the hooptie boy, its not a cover up
See Im a young black boy who dont give a fuck, what
This that gangsta shit that make you wanna grab your shit
Cock back and blast some shit
Empty, reload the clip
You wont find nothing hotter than this
Whatcha know about it
This that gangsta shit that make you wanna blaze this spliff
Get drunk, grab a fifth, open it, guzzle it quick
You wont find nothing hotter than this
Whatcha know about it
Doin fifty on the shore, Range no tags
Punch pulled up, Kendrick in the back
A Da Bu$iness in that rag, Phantom on feet
And Problem in the diamond light pushin that GT
Hood niggas with class, give respect where its due
Came up with one boo and that was just to stay true
True to my music and everything that I do
Instead of practicing me you should focus on doin you
So nigga fuck yo crew, what you wanna do?
Wack emcees never get no love Im not enthused
And you can save all ya non-creative point of views
Cause me? Imma produce and you just reducing ya crew
Now how Im posed to work if I aint gettin paid?
Gotta call Terrace Martin if you cant call Dre
Now with that bein said there is nothin else to say
Was already understood, doesnt have to be explained
If it was never lost, how could it be saved?
I do this for my soul, I do this for LA
I do this for the love, man I do it for the game
And the memory of Miles Davis and John Coltrane
How could you blame them bastards, when they aint have no raisin?
They dont want no higher learning, they stick to the basics
And they dont wanna work for that white devil cause he racist
Neglected of knowledge, thats all they know, how could you blame em?
And I hate to say it but I had to as a man
We cooperated with em and fell victim to they plan
And after losin Malcolm and Martin they scared to take a stand
If I call em pussy its some bullshit, when will it end
So I dont really care bout who they say who is the best
All I know is that it shows within my music and my checks
I swear this is the best thing next to havin sex
Geek smashed on niggas wont let my foot up off they necks, yep
Huh, strap it on me and let me solidify
And purposely intertwine, my positive thoughts apply in genocide
Compton communists are, shiftily, in peace
Whoevers in charge like Charles no sit-com
Beat him like a kick drum
Rip a hole from his lips to where the nigga shit from
Compton, Cali nigga!
Its all music, rule-less
Like a Ali fight, pushin Al Green or Barry White
Boy this Cali lifes amazin
Palm trees, bomb weed and bitches
All my aprons and rubber gloves went cookin in hells kitchen
Bustin shots that could crack back spleens
The lil rapper that could commercialize the backpack scene
Who sick? Boy, shit ... Im vaccine on flight green
Paper planin on the plane in first class, mad?
Because Im on the bubble of success
Stressed over life, street still pokin out my chest
Bitches love my confidence, I wear it like a vest
Sippin Rosé Moët, drinkin til Im lost
Hustlin everyday, bail away my thoughts
Anticipatin the win but, ready for the loss
Got her livin like a boss; Tony Danza, been bananas
Since the red rags of bustin out a stanzas
Problem, answer, not one found!
Mayweather couldnt box me into one sound, he wouldnt last one round!
My songs clever, my pens better, than ever
A trendsetter with a vendetta...
Big bag of chips on my shoulder standin tall like a soldier
Snakes in the grass I laugh dodgin the cobras!
Scraped from the past, we amped wantin the Kobra
Im far gone mommy, Relax baby, its over,
Money pile coma, rovin in the Range
Be it dope takin its toll please have exact change, MOTHERFUCKER!!

And if Im off beat know I’m un-sober

New dough for the new year and I sumo on a rap peer
Not a rapper, I’m a raptor
Thats a T-Rex in a V-neck for the rapture
I’m a factor and your facial
I will fracture to a fraction
No one-half and I hate math
Pastor’s like Eddie long, fucking maricon
Took me mighty long to get here
Nigga, Fuck!
The first sound we hear on good kid, m.A.A.d. city is a prayer: Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving us with your precious blood, voices murmur, evoking a family dinner gathering. The albums cover art, a grubby Polaroid, provides a visual prompt for the scene: Baby Kendrick dangles off an uncles knee in front of a squat kitchen table displaying a 40-ounce and Lamars baby bottle. The snapshot is such an unvarnished peek into the rappers inner life that staring at it for too long feels almost invasive. This autobiographical intensity is the albums calling card. Listening to it feels like walking directly into Lamars childhood home and, for the next hour, growing up alongside him.
Lamar has subtitled the record A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar, and the comparison rings true: You could take the albums outline and build a set for a three-act play. It opens on a 17-year-old Kendrick with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental, driving his mothers van to see a girl named Sherane. As his voice darts and halts in a rhythm that mimics his over-eager commute, Lamar explores the furtiveness of young lust: Its deep-rooted, the music of being young and dumb, he raps. The song is interrupted by the first of several voice mail recordings that delineate the albums structure: Kendricks mother, rambling into his phone and pleading for him to return her car. These voicemails appear through the record, reinforcing that good kid, m.A.A.d city is partly a love letter to the grounding power of family. In this albums world, family and faith are not abstract concepts: They are the fraying tethers holding Lamar back from the chasm of gang violence that threatens to consume him.
All this weighty material might make good kid, m.A.A.d city sound like a bit of a drag. But the miracle of this album is how it ties straightforward rap thrills-- dazzling lyrical virtuosity, slick quotables, pulverizing beats, star turns from guest rappers-- directly to its narrative. For example, when Backseat Freestyle leaked last week, its uncharacteristic subject matter took some fans by surprise. But on the album, it marks the moment in the narrative when young Kendricks character first begins rapping, egged on by a friend who plugs in a beat CD. Framed this way, his damn, I got bitches chant gets turned inside out: This isnt an alpha males boast. Its a pipsqueaks first pass at a chest-puff. Its also a monster of a radio-ready single, with Kendrick rapping in three voices over an insane Hit-Boy beat.
Lamar grew up in Compton, and ghosts of West Coast gangsta-rap haunt this albums edges, casting shadows on Kendricks complicated relationship with his hometown. When The Art of Peer Pressure brings Kendrick and his friends to Rosecrans Ave., the music downshifts into menacing G-funk mode as a salute to hallowed ground. Ice Cube’s “Bird in the Hand” is invoked to set up “m.A.A.d city” , which appropriately marks the moment when real violence erupts. Here, Kendrick sounds like a terrified kid: I made a promise to see you bleeding, he raps, his voice pitched at a pleading, near-hysterical sob. In response, the voice of Comptons Most Wanted rapper MC Eiht leers, Wake yo punk ass up, like a father figure of the Darth Vader variety.
Which brings us to the albums most visible benefactor and most unsettled presence: Dr. Dre. In recent months, Dre has availed himself of the fresh-career oxygen Kendricks rise has pumped into his atmosphere, lumbering out of his corporate airlock to stand with Lamar on magazine covers. But the role he plays in Lamars story feels muddled and unresolved. On an album that manages to seamlessly work a smirking Drake and a highly recognizable Janet Jackson sample into the fabric of a larger narrative, it is only Dres appearance, on the final track Compton, that feels like an uneasy outlier.
Compton is the victory lap, the coronation. Coming after the stunning 12-minute denouement Sing About Me, Im Dying of Thirst, in which Lamar delivers a verse from a peripheral character that is the albums most dazzling stroke of empathy, it cant help but be a small deflation. The moment of arrival in any artists story is always less interesting than their journey, and theres a disconnect in hearing Lamar and Dre stunt over Just Blazes blaring orchestral-soul beat. Dres music is part of the landscape that Kendrick grew up in but his actual appearance has a certain Truman Show feel to it.
But the true ending of good kid, m.A.A.d. city takes place at the end of the previous song, Real, which represents the spiritual victory that the albums story has thrashed its way towards. Finally grasping that none of that shit-- money, power, respect, loving your block-- make me real, Lamar embraces what does, as his parents put the albums central concerns to bed: Any nigga can kill a man, his father admonishes. That dont make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family. And his mother: If I dont hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man... Tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton... When you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement. And thats the best way to give back to your city. And I love you, Kendrick.

Swear i will have a ball
And if i keep workin hard
One day ill have it all
And i aint talkin about cash
Not even talkin bout the cash
Not even the case
And i dont want a bad bich
So get the fuck out my face
Im trapped in this place
They won give me no space
I try to inhale and breathe
And i start up a chase
Im gettin close to the gates
I can feel it in my soul
So i gots to rebel
And tell em all that its on
Gettin calls from god
I can here the ringtone
But i miseed tht call
And received a text
Sayin its all for the best
So keep on grindin
And be expecting a test
Oh and one more thing never strive for the less
Competition is feirce
But dont shed no tears
Just work for some years
Itl come to your ears
And it will open your eyes
And show you the prize
And i know that you know that i speak no lies
Just listen to me and you will reach the sky
Verse 2
And tonight

To anyone that ever hated

Ill reach the top
With all i got chasin my dream
Like a cop chasen kids with marijuana
Yes i am sober but i can get higher than i stoner
Smoken of my bars i hit it hard
Off my gaurd
Oh my lord
Off the charts
Im a star
Must get far
Workin hard
You think you know it all
Boa sit down
Wit ya dumbass ego
Actin like a dumbass clown
You jus arrogant
Thinkin that you run this town
Talkin shit about rappers to make yourself look better
Thats pathetic
Better yet sympathetic
I feel sorry for you
Boa i wish i was a medic
Cus clearly you are sick
Infected with jealousy
Creating your enemies
With ridiculous tendency
Strong than hennessy
I refuse to be shot down
Without a strong quick burn to the stomach
Shoot me all you want i will feel nothin from it
Tulani boa soul rebel
I will never plummetgun it
I love it
Keep it 100
Keep it dont shun it

I feed off of love hate will only make me vomit
They feed off of hate and im wishen they would stop it
Ay, sounwave turn this shit up nigga!
Turn this shit up, sounwave turn this shit up nigga!
Tell me who the bitch nigga hatin on me?
Jumpin on my dick but this dick aint free
To Pimp A Butterfly another classic cd
Ghetto lullaby for everyone they MC
Blow blow blow blow blow
Nigga now R.I.P, my diligence is only meant to write your eulogy
Every second, every minute
Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
Im talkin about dark room, perfume, go, go
I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you aint never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
Youre in the mood for empathy, theres blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And yall curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, dont approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that aint good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
Less I write it down for real, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin sure my punctuation curve, every letter heres true
Livin my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
Im talkin poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, its you lookin in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, its you lookin for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin, sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, its coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, thats your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and youll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

Say it again
Born to win
Living in God
Hoping its the end
I....Ho! Ho! Ho!
Im waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow, and I sweat my rust
Im breathing in the chemicals
Im breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, whoa
Im waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa, Im radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, Im radioactive, radioactive
I raise my flags, don my clothes
Its a revolution, I suppose
Well paint it red to fit right in, whoa
Im breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, whoa
Im waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa, Im radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, Im radioactive, radioactive
All systems go, the sun hasnt died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside
Im waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa, Im radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, Im radioactive, radioactive
Ya Veegy the realest
They hate on me coz im living
Im talking JD all night
My homies know what the deal is
My brothers tying the knot
I told him cherish those moments
Every morning, you roll over
And you see what heaven brought you
My flow is so sick like Ne-Yo
So Heat like Chino
Banked up like Tito
Im tryina hit these key notes
I find myself turning up
Now not only on weekend
Ive got contacts on my phone
I really wonder who she is
Man Ive got nothing to hide
I said on top of a hill
I met some skeletons on the way
Need that secrecy bill
Coz man the stakes are high
I got me a knife Im eating steak tonight
Im living but i need a break tonight
Too much of life could be like Kryptonite
Whats good?
Im Living
Howre you doing?
Im Living
Are you okay?
Im Living
You sure youre straight?
Im Living
Now turn it up?
Im Living
E C
Im Living
P E
Im Living
Where you at? X2
My vision’s bothered by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
The starving’ll speed on ya, stampede on ya
Impede on your pockets then pee on ya
Dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spending, established, with women dining and laughing
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash in
To society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
Your seatbelts twice, when I rolled them dice, I crapped
So many times I can build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That’s what my mental say, but my physical’s been detached, I’m on some other shit
Like fuck the government, I’m higher rankings, where’s the mothership?
I made a covenant that I was changing but my luck is bent
Quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?
Left him face down like he was planking
In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation’s insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging?
Regardless of who you pick know life’s a bitch when you ain’t focused nigga
Chorus
Man I just came here to have a good time
I cant myself, myself
And if youve got a problem with that
Then you can move to the left, to the left X2
I dont know Yay, sometimes we can be so ignorant
Fuck, watch how I kill em with the funky rhythm
Ill bomb if you dont feel em, piranhas in em
Feed my persona as I get deep as Nostradamus
No stallin like the , nuh-uh, 
Im ballin, cut up your pajamas if youre sleepin on me
No promise, no peekin, homie
Youre tryin to confiscate the flow, I know
So I switch it quicker than my bitches
If they want your attention
One thing for sure, they gon get it
Im cursed with the worlds negatives
Probably thinkin Im hurt, but thats the only way I can live
War, money, cash, drugs, got me feelin like AIDS
Walkin inside the club
Paid in full, it more be like 
.38 snub huggin my waist like it had arms
Then I bear it, so I guess it really does
No paperwork on this marriage
He love when life better than life
Drunk off Paul, nigga, pourin by the Rover, bitches
Pourin hollows over haters, we killin insecure niggas
Feelin like the old Jigga, old Nas, old Big, new Pac
Oh my God, hes alive, he dropped bombs on you intellects
Bombin everythin from the streets to the Internet
Hear the instrumental wet
Then Im a bust a nut, yep, Im a fuckin nut
That is not an Escalade, thats a damn armored truck
Shoot who? Shot what?
You aint popped shit but some bubblegum and a bump
Who you motherfuckers want?
Leave a motherfucker slumped from the fuckin pump
Hes a peanut to an elephant, put that nigga in a trunk
Might be out in Houston, lean in my pimp cup
Ride in 84s, throwed like a shot put
Hoes on my jock like Im from the ATL
In our new block, choppers on the rooftop
Flip a nigga like he was a NBA mascot
Strip a nigga from his Wade cap to his two socks
Got it from them Compton blocks
Raised from my grandpas
Every day, caught a fade like we like we own the barber shop
Goons in the parkin lot
Who are you to fool if you bark a lot with no bite like an iguana
Get killed right in front of your momma
Hold tight, coroner comin
Summertime, perfect time for dove huntin
And you a woman want to be at my house with her ass out
She climaxed and passed out
And promotional flyers, K-Dot be the flyest
Eat ten rappers a day, thats a hell of a diet
Straight up like a kangaroo
Pumpin like a fist do from a pro-black
This is automatic rap, made a minute, take a second
Im a get it maybe here for a minute when Im finished
Lets begin it
I fucked up the rap game and you aint even know it
I just fucked whats her name and you aint even know it 
She got a beep tattoo and you aint even know it 
We about to form a little group and you aint even know it, lets get it
Stuck in a rock and a hard place
Eminem, Pac and where God stay
Timberlands pop that jaw bone
Now bitch nigga, tell me how that tar taste
And even Tarzan can get swung on
I never hung out with the loud mouth
You got a foul mouth
And that dead body gon smell foul when it fouls out
She filed my nails in the Bahamas
We found ourselves in the Bahamas
She found God, meditation, and peace
I found myself without a condom
You know everybody having them babies
Its a beautiful thing it aint crazy
If a rapper monogamous, you know what the problem is?
Too many bitches got rabies
And I hate a ho-hoppin woman
Stank pussy-poppin woman
You fuckin fool dont know about you
But my dick need 17 years on it
Anything after that is just a bonus
And I been in the lab with my opponents
And since Sway done swayed that list
He got a flatscreen the next morning
Tell em I need my credit when its due
Tell em I need my lettuce when its new
Tell em I got a fetish for fine fabric, Franklins and saying, Fuck you
Tell em its TDE til Im DDTd in that grave
And Top Dawg is proof
til my nigga Whoo Kid get free, aint shit comin for free
Im bout to rape you niggas til you recoup
Kendrick Lamar: Cause ignorance is bliss
Sigidy: Its nearly sad as toddler as he wonders home
He shooting baskets he wondering if his fathers home
But realizing his fathers shot in the collar bone, they snapped it like a toddler bone and now hes in a foster home
His anger turns to loneliness until hes mad again
Scout looking through the scraps for a weapon to shoot it back at them
Visions of sadness he pointing it and imagining bullets travel like javelins and stabbed em in the abdomen
He went from this passive child to a massive style black a wild child on the block smoking black and milds
Living in sadness is madness if you can crack a smile
A once proud and happy child is just sadden now
The kid grows up chillin playing madden now
Bout to have a child of his own and this niggas rappin now
Rappin and packing the strap instead of em backin down, clappin down clowns round town for the cabbage now
Smack the ass on the spouse hittin the black and mild
Ill admit in the beginning I didnt give a fuck about you
You came and you went, thought I could choose living without you
But now Im feelin sick cause your ass aint around
You cheatin on me , with every motherfucker in town
I tried to play it like its cool, but I feel the repercussion
On top of that your ass is rollin round with my cousin
I think I passed the breaking point cause I done copped a pound
I hear you streaking through niggas pockets, Im layin em down
 And I aint stoppin till you trapped in the safe
Now my base aint safe so we could skip three states
Switch place after the break, more moves to make
Cause Im in love with this trap ass bitch called Kate
This money gon keep me from looking funny
And bummy, let her run me cause she bout it
Monday through Sunday we dont play no games here
You know how we get down, you know all the hoes love me
Money makes the world go round
So Ima kick in the door
With the Mac 10, or the lone 44
Screaming give me the dough back nigga
Please, dont ask no questions
This a robbery nigga
You already know
Yo pockets kinda thin, shawty wanna go out on a date
Shit I got no chips to spend, but I said its OK
Cause momma was drivin the Benz
Her Jimmy Choos had me convinced
I said she was pretty, she love a nigga compliments
I had the thing with me, she didnt know
By the end of the day, she be breakin off them arguments
I said fuck the ass and titties
I want the jewels and Benjies
I swear a nigga pockets was empty, starving
I whispered to myself, a nigga bout to come up
She like Oh I beg your pardon
Oh nothing, I was thinking bout your valet parking
Excuse me, now give me the I know they 
I dont wife usually, but today Ill be your man
So we went to the restaurant, I said OK
I think about the getaway shit, over lunch
Like what type of jewels I want, everything
I aint goin back to the block till her body is clean
Snatch it off her cuticles, takin off the pinky ring
I know this shit good but it bad as it seems
So hate conversation, little does she know
That nigga like you and me was patiently waiting, give it up
I wanted heartbeat, now thanks for the business
Go home, oh yeah please call me
Yeah, a nigga starving out front of your place
Put the beam to your face, I dont really want the safe
I want everything in your house
From your TVs, couches your dog and your spouse
Everything is valuable, so is you
Cooperate so a nigga wont have to blast you
We all know what this Mac could do
At point blank range, its a closed casket fool
Im the Watts bandit, yeah I came up
Put all these goods in a pick-up truck
Rollin down Central, I spotted me a target
This nigga, he was doin too much flossin
Yea the truck I parked it
Hop out cock back the heater
Run up in his ass in his beemer
Im yellin out, hand it over, fore its all over
Put a shell through you and your mother fucking chauffer
He was looking choked up, so he start sweating
Looking down the barrel of my Wesson
Yeah hes getting robbed, he know he cant stop it
He gave me the keys, and every fucking thing up in his pockets
Started up the Beemer, parked it where my truck was
Young niggas like what up blood
Im like what up blood, this nigga came behind me
Said hand is over nigga, or that your ass is mine
Shout to my nigga Shellcase for doin this beat for me too
That nigga look like a praying mantis
Drunk off a hard liquor, pourin bottles over bitches
Pourin hollows over haters, killin insecure niggas
Feelin like the old Jigga, old Nas
Old BIG, new Pac, oh my God, hes alive, he drop
Bombs on your intellect
Bombin everything from the streets to the internet
Get the instrumental wet
Then Ima buss a nut, yep, Im a my fuckin nut
That is not an Escalade, thats a damn armor truck
Shoot who? Shot what?
You aint popped shit but some bubblegum and a bump
Who you motherfuckers want?
Leave a motherfucker slumped from the fuckin pump
Hes a peanut to an elephant, put that nigga in the trunk
Might be held in Houston, lean in my pimp cup
Ridin 84s, throw it like a shot put
Hoes on my jock like Im from the ATL
And I know black choppers on the rooftop
Flip a nigga like he was a NBA mascot
Strip a nigga from his wave cap to his tube socks
Got it from my grandpops, raised on them Compton blocks
Every day caught a fade like we on the barbershop
Goons in the parkin lot
Ooh, yous a fool if you bark a lot with no bite
Like an iguana, get killed right in front of your momma
Hold tight, coroner coming
Summertime, perfect time for duck hunting
And your women wanna be in my house
With her ass out, she climax, then pass out
Like promotional flyers, K Dot be the flyest
Eat ten rappers a day, now thats a hell of a diet
Your girlfriend, she all on me
Say she wanna clean my dirty laundry
Say she wanna clean my dirty laundry
Bitch, Im K Dot and Im keepin it friendly
I got this jumpin like a kangaroo, pumpin like a fist do
From the pro black, this is automatic rap
Have a seat, grab a snack, we gon be here for a second
Armageddon might be here, when I finish, pray that Heaven has a home
Im alone in my own galaxy
Youll never have a head start with a dead battery
And they screamin agony, when I write shit
My life is filled with excitin
Visions of a nigga making mills with a strikin
Impact for ten years, Ive been here before
See, this is all premature
I start the war like an instigator
Sharper than some cream gators
On a Thursday night, mix the Vodka with the Sprite
Better yet, roll the dice, watch me come up
He want to with me, he cool, put your gun up
Ho ottenuto, Ho ottenuto, Ho ottenuto, Ho ottenuto—
Lealtà, ho lealtà nel mio DNA
Un quarto di cocaina, ho guerra e pace nel mio DNA
Ho ottenuto potere, veleno, dolore e gioia nel mio DNA
Ho ottenuto una spinta però, flow ambizioso nel mio DNA
Sono nato così, tipo uno così, immacolata concezione
Mi trasformo così, mi esibisco così, era la nuova arma di Yeshua
Io non contemplo, io medito, poi via tua fottuta testa
Questo che mette i bambini a letto
Questo che Ho ottenuto, Ho ottenuto, Ho ottenuto, Ho ottenuto—
Realtà, Ho solo ucciso la merda dato che è nel mio DNA
Ho ottenuto milioni, Ho ottenuto ricchezze nel mio DNA
Mi sono oscurato, ho ottenuto il male, quel marcio nel mio DNA
Sono sceso, ho un cuore incasinato nel mio DNA
Ho solo vinto ancora, e vinco ancora tipo Wimbledon, Io servo
Si, è lui ancora, il suono che è in moto è tipo un uccello
Tu vedi fuochi dartificio e gomme di Corvette sgommare nella strada
So come lavori, So solo chi sei
Vedi, sei una, sei una, sei una—
Puttana, i tuoi ormoni probabilmente cambiano dentro il mio DNA
Il problema è, tutti i succhia merda dentro il tuo DNA
Papà probabilmente ha fatto la spia, eredità dentro il tuo DNA
La spina dorsale non esiste, nato come una medusa, Valuto
Vedi, il mio pedigree sicuramente non tollera la merda
Che ho passato probabilmente ti ha offeso, questo è il figlio maggiore di Paula
Conosco assassini,convinti
Bruciatori, sostenitori, ladri, smidollati, morti, redenti
Scolari, padri morti con bambini e
Vorrei essere nutrito di perdono
Si, si, si, si, DNA del soldato 
Nato dentro la bestia, la mia esperienza è stata testata in seconda elementare
Quando avevo 9 anni, al telefono, in un motel, non avevamo nessun posto dove stare
A 29 anni,Ho fatto così bene, fare la ruota nella mia villa
E brillerò come dovrei, estroverso antisociale
E eccellente significa il lavoro extra
E assenza che cazzo hai sentito
E i pessimisti non mi hanno mai colpito
E Nazareth chiederà il suo caso
Il motivo per cui il mio potere è qui sulla terra
Saluta la verità, quando dice il profeta
Ho-Ho ottenuto lealtà, ottenuto realtà nel mio DNA
Questa è il perché io dico che lhip hop ha fatto molti più danni ai giovani afroamericani che il razzismo in questi anni
Ho ottenuto lealtà, ottenuto realtà nel mio DNA
Vivo una vita migliore, Sto lanciando diversi dadi,fanculo la tua vita
Ho ottenuto lealtà, ottenuto realtà nel mio DNA
Vivo una mi-, fanculo la tua vita
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Questa è la mia eredità, tutto ciò che sto ereditando
Soldi e potere, la mecca dei matrimoni
Dimmi qualcosa
Voi figli di puttana non potete dirmi niente
Preferirei morire che ascoltarti
Il mio DNA non è un imitazione
Il tuo DNA è un abominio
Ecco comè quando sei in Matrix
Schivando proiettili, raccogliendo quello che semini
E montando il filmato, vivendo spostandosi
E dormendo in una villa
Sorseggiando da un Grammy, camminando nelledificio
Diamante nel tetto, biglie per terra
Spiaggia dentro la villa, sbirciando fuori dalla finestra
Bimbo nella piscina, obiettivi da padrino
Solo il Signore sa che sono stato martellato
Schivando paparazzi, impazzendo davanti ai cameraman
Mangiando al Four Daughters, Brock indossa sandali
Yoga il Lunedì, stirandosi verso il Nirvana
Guardando tutti i serpenti, curvo tutti i falsi
Il telefono mai acceso, io non parlo
Io non comprometto, Io penetro solamente
Sesso, soldi,omicidio—queste sono le pause
Questi sono i tempi, livello numero 9
Guada su nel cielo, il 10 sta arrivando
La sentenza sta arrivando, gli omicidi stanno arrivando
Figlio di puttana, Ho vincitori nella mia strada
Non sei una merda senza un corpo sulla cintura
Non sei una merda senza un biglietto sul piatto
Non sei abbastanza malato per tirartelo addosso
Ynon sei abbastanza ricco per colpire il sacco e pattinare
Ditemi quando la distruzione sarà il mio fato
Sarò il tuo fato, sarà il nostro fato
Pace al mondo, lasciatelo ruotare
Sesso, soldi, omicidi—il nostro DNA
Oakland and 2Pac
I move oak, you see, Im nothin like 
Thinkin they hot cause they homies said they was a few times
Which is too many times of lyin to you, they tellin a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record twenty-four hours, these niggas better get they bars up
I bench press this rap stuff
Got it locked like handcuffs, I threw away the key
My cool is on, she love my AC
My jewels is on and I wish one of yalld try ride me
I shoot and have you land between the sheets with the Isleys
We push the coupe like a 
The helicopters comin, realize theres nothin behind us
Behind me, Your Honor
I fuck over these beats with no condom
This aint rap, its really a porno, rewind it back
, its back to definin a loss, correct, they dont obey
Yall aint nice, nigga, yall just okay
Yeah, theyre more than a little 
Im Mike Jordan in his prime, modern-day Isaac Hayes
 equivalent to the theme song of your career
Study my craft, you ignorant
I do it without a pen and a pad, just inspiration
Somethin yall never had
If my pockets is somethin you tryin to grab
See, I pulled out the rocket and peel you back like scab
You old news, old dudes, get out my way
Let the young boy come through, dont mention my age
Shit, Im on a mission for pay
And you astronaut niggas just crowd in my space
Look, youre not in my atmosphere
You can act like youre here
But actually you aint accurate fuckin with this music biz
The industry like, Fuck it, let the music be his
No theme park, Im not tryin to amuse you kids
Small shark, Jaws is here, jump in the water
Do we really fuck with President Carter?
My replys that I cant stay away from the bosses
Got the biddin war poppin like a auction
Five or ten labels like, What he hatin for?
Except the zeros and more
Remember havin Aftermath sittin on my door
Money in front of me, I couldnt open the door
Im so far ahead of my time
I got people five years from now pressin rewind
Im hardly impressed with yall
I hate rappers, where the true artists at?
If it aint a good picture you draw, dont bring it to the architect
Often yall arguin about who got next
Claimin yall runnin the game, niggas is barely walkin yet
Hoppin all over beats without going through trainin camp
Try studyin a few greats, then maybe youll be where Im at
Your songwritin aint great, your mixtapes medioc
You recycle the same quotes, youre not switchin your flow
Your flow in the same place
Dont just , expand
Try to be more creative, perhaps
My rap friends, I aint sayin that you wack, psych
Like a invoice, Im just statin the facts, right?
Youd have to count the metaphors I write
In fact, youve been a factor youve feared your whole life
No TV show, dont compare me with them
Thats like Jaws versus Nemo, a gorilla to a chimp
A Jordan versus Kukoč
A Tony Montana with blow in his nose to a Nino
Uh, haha
Busta had a dream
Reek Da Vilainn had a dream, haha
J-Doe had a dream
Hold up, okay
All my life I want money and power
I thought Id get that movin the white powder
Then I started spittin, anybody can get devoured
I made that shit, better turn me up louder
Damn, I got bitches 
Damn, I got bitches 
Oh, damn, I got bitches 
But I cant be consistent 
They all wanna get me
Theres no time cause Im busy 
You see me once then you miss me
Im on the streets, on my grizzy
I gotta scrape up these pitties, she at the door with them titties
She pull out one, she pull out two
I guess I got my five mo minutes
Yes, Im trying hard to resist it
So, I gotta pray for forgiveness
Cause Lord knows, Lord knows I got too many bitches, okay 
Im with a model, why you holla at a basic bitch? 
I got a bottle, see me pourin up that Ace and shit 
Ah nah nah, nigga dont get mad at me 
She see me pourin waterfalls and tried to chase the shit 
She aint used to being round all this amazingness 
She see me five feet away and now she cant resist 
You know I had to drop a verse up on my favorite shit 
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn, I got bitches: wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers 
Our hand on the steering wheel, the game is like my taxi
Im the one thats driving all you rappers to the backseat
Conglomerate running shit, welcome to the track meet
I keep at least a hundred racks just where all my stacks be
Taxi cab fashion, got your bitch up in the backseat
Making noises like she have sheet, while I stabbed it
Its the money guys, yeah, we all about that mula
Put that ruga to your tuta, now they screamin hallelujah 
Salute to the big homies thats banging on the West Side
9 shots, fill my homie C Murda and Aesop
Yeah, that be that blood love, show my niggas thug love
Even though they , money what we love, blood
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn, I got bitches: wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers
Let it run, Ali
Martin had a dream

I know about killa California
Badmon no fear fi haunt ya
But we no care about not a thing at all
No if it kill, we buss ya boy
When I leave the house, I cant forget the weapon
Been through more shootouts than Hot 97
Equipped with the black Mac 11
Aint no half steppin, Watts what Im reppin
Pull up, whip same color as fire
Obesity rims, anorexic tires
Bob Marley in the Swisher, I gotta get higher
The Grim Reaper handin out tickets like flyers
Crips killin Crips, Bloods killin Bloods
Thats how it is now in Killa Cali, bruh
You gotta stay strapped, homie, never slip up
Bullets love skin, youll get that ass touched
I glide through the streets, gat in my lap
One under the seat, K in the trunk like who want it with me?
Dont make it to trauma, youll lying in sheets
We the last of a dying breed
I know about killa California
Badmon no fear fi haunt ya

Bo bo buss a shot for your area

Rah rah buss a shot for your area
Cause we no scared of yah
Im from the city where they concentrate on nothin
But that red flag, blue flag, gang bang, murder state
Elementary kids liable they catch a case
So dont be surprised if a ten year old put one in your face
Kick in your door then put it to your face
Shake you up a little bit then ask you where the safe
Streets aint safe and so I got the toolie on me
Movin like a Mario brother, pardon me brother
But you gon have to come out that whip, your mama might love ya but
Im lovin whats on your wrist, Im lovin whats on your neck
Im lovin whats in your head rest
You might as well give it to me or or be in peace with the rest deceased
Dippin in lanes, duckin, dodgin police
After we get away we celebrate over chronic tree
Who did you think rollin with me?
K-Dot, Compton, visit my streets
I know about killa California
Badmon no fear fi haunt ya
But we no care about not a thing at all
No if it kill, we buss ya boy
Bo bo buss a shot for your area
Bo bo buss a shot for your area
Rah rah buss a shot for your area
Cause we no scared of yah
Rock welcomes you to Killa Killa Cali
Thi-thi-this the murder capi where them boys trigger happy
Concrete jungle, tell me who barrell a sparrow
It dont matter, we ghetto gotta gotta stack bundles
Dont matter the weather, man you gotta keep Berettas
Bullets rainin like showers, they kill for money and power
Man thats murder murder get murdered at any hour
Any minute and any second Im standin tall as a tower
Ghetto strong survive, the weak get swallowed, devoured
Sorry theres no love for no cowards, if you one thats a problem
If you got a problem, well solve it for you, partner, no problem
If I cant reach you then my little homies got em
Niggas up on the hustle moving packs of that powder
Plus these bitches aint shit, man its all about a dollar
Bust a shot for my area with those 40 calibers
You gotta be a leader, got no respect for followers

There is nobody, no-one to outrun me
So give me a run for my money
Sippin bubbly, feelin lovely, livin lovely
Just love me
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Just love me
If I didnt ride blade on curb would you still love me?
If I minimised my net worth would you still me?
Keep it a hundred, Id rather you trust me than to love me
Keep it a whole one hund, dont got you I got nothing
I got something, hol up, we gon function, no assumptions
Feelin like Tyson with it, knock it out twice Im with it
Only for the night, Im kidding
Only for the night, yeah, hold me for life, yeah hold me for life, lets get it
Hit that shoulder lean
I know what coming over me
Backstroke oversea, cause I got what you need
Already on ten, our money comin in
All feeling going out
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace, inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition inside my DNA
I said Im geeked and Im fired up
All I want tonight is get high up
Ooh you lookin good its to die for
Imma give it to you good like its to die for
Its a secret society
All we ask is trust
All we got is us
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty, oh
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
This what God feel like, yeah
Laughing to the bank like aha, yeah
You feel some type of way then aha, yeah
Flex on swole like aha, yeah
If I gotta slap another, see yeah, imma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, imma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, make it look sexy
They wont take me out my element, no
Take me out my element
They wont take me out my element, no
If I die tomorrow my city would come with me now
I swear the sky will fall
Ayo, the sky scorchin’, acid rain fallin’ from the porches
These boys out here peddlin’ porcelain to the less fortunate
We knee deep in the bride of the four horsemen
Can’t tell the trees from where the forest is
More coffins filled with good lookin’ corpses
The Nickerson Gardens is like a graveyard, braveheart cemeteries
Seventh grade school picture on the cover of the obituary
I wrote it in my scrolls, literary student, a visionary nuisance
The voice of the movement, peep out the window, articulate confusion
The YGs raise the baby thugs like soldiers
Teach ‘em to run spots and throw ‘em from the shoulder
Shooters, gun toters, the older ones control them like MK ULTRA
Violence, the code of silence, baby girl wylin’, she got a thousand problems
She do hair and sell dope out of the same housing, she be too busy mouthing
In everybody business, the first one to start singing faced with a sentence
Section 8 tenants, the black and white buildings, parole violators, government assistance
GR recipients, collect checks and hit licks, they sleeping with two bricks
Sold them wholesale to a snitch
They caught him on camera, promised him a sweet deal if he flipped
Plus they got him with the hammers, gun powder residue
That’s what I seen out my project window
Let it run, Q
If I die tomorrow my city would come with me now
I swear the sky will fall
It’s only fair that I warn ya out in California
It ain’t safe to wear less than armor
But event the night fall when the day break is draped in smog
Shorty got longer arms than the law
Thinking he could box with God
You catch an onslaught even at breakfast, think is hard
Pause, yeah, they bake on bake meaning the couch
Young nigga shoot back and watch and hit everybody
Cause everybody ain’t affiliated
Whether you active or faking, it’s part of the demographic
That’s what’s fueling my hatred for the inner city
Blues, this music when them tools clatchin’
Kids get to answer questions in their middle school classes
Can’t recite a rap classic verbatim
Take 36 ounces, break ‘em down without weighing them
We can’t pay ‘em the attention crime paying ‘em
The ‘jects raise us to raise guns, the day ones
When them raids come, just play dumb, don’t say nothing
Do the bidding, spray and blend in, take the fade
Educate yourself, read up on the case
80% time served, 40k flipped the bird
Read the terms of your probation
He ain’t listen, he’d rather kick it with no henchmen
Gang conjunction, that’s violation, no more smiling faces
That’s the basis of what’s facing the younger generation
No more Reaganomics, just Obama’s promise
Got me sick to my stomach, make me want to vomit
A vicious cycle in rotation like the chronic
They light the chronic, sip the Henny, load the hollows in the semi
Pull it back until it’s empty on the enemy
That looks like them, self-hatred is a rare gem
Get out the water if you can’t swim
If I die tomorrow my city would come with me now
I swear the sky will fall
So you can tell ‘em come get me now
When are we getting old?
Theres sixteen ounces to every pound
Some shit is bout to go down
Got sixty-four of em
Thats four of em, smoke somethin
Burn it down, this shit is four for a pound
Yall need cream, thats equivalent to a sixteen
See, when Im rappin Im trappin
Wasnt really good, well, subtract
Then Im steady addin, this is just a fraction
Blunt matchin after matchin
Matchin after matchin
All by myself, ask Michael Phelps
Bean pies and Philadelph cheesesteaks on the menu
Projects right across from the venue
After the show, I went outside and mingled
Im feelin safe with the homie named God whos great
Elijah Muhammad the 8th
The Muslim homie told me hes straight
Sent him a dub and a demo tape
Penetrate the streets with the heat
Like , global warmin in December
Bathe in the , thats how the kids raised
So a burner aint nothin
Shoot him in his back for cold frontin
Let him hold somethin, he with the Devil down south
Tell his ass to walk it out
Burner in his mouth, blindfolded on the couch
Give me the loot, give me the loot fore I shoot
Rip a tooth and your tonsils too
Exit out your neck bone, man, your shit gone
Im and notorious
Niggas always gettin me understood
Better ask your hood, they know whats good
Warnin shot, Q, bitch
I could stand in a pool of gasoline lightin a blunt
And never catch on fire
How come? You silly motherfucker, Im fire
Smack the Devil over the cheek
Gave him a third-degree burn
Iced it down the same week and told him, Youll be okay
A lot of rappers are desperate to be a star by the day
They hydroplanin
They hopin that they catch they big break
What are you sayin?
I feel Im the one like a magician
With a stick inside his hand of a name of a messy cane
I gets ignorant with you
Snap your picture, bitch, Im famous
I came in this world with nuts in my palm
And drinkin Paul Masson
In a stolen Cavalier like I took LeBron
Locked him in a basement and amputated his shootin arm
Now thats a stretch, Ab-Soul
Like the fifty-mile strip when Im pimpin these hoes
Call me Dolemite, no, I take that back
Found out he gay as a or the way that they rap
I wish I had the very first verse I wrote
Id spit it right now
So you can see the vast progression and the style
Started as a child
Now Im a grown man like Benjamin Button in his fifties
Fuck with me
Still aint learnt the power of a dollar, disregardin Fif
Not cause I dont like him, just cause I dont save shit
So high on my horse
If I fall off I get kicked by a hoof fore I hit the hood
And that was over they head, but I wish a nigga would
Disrespect my intellect, Im a cocky individual
No subliminals, try to attack and Ill react like chemicals
The doc shouldve brought him some of my moms inner tubes
Cause now Im in the view of millions, takin interviews
I got interludes better than your singles
Wont stop till I got a better reason to 
And if any of yall want a piece of the God
On 12/25 we send grief to your squad
The only problem I got now is label offers on the table
Like a table cloth is but Im cautious
Im like what Jaws is to crawfish
The big shot, thats why I talk my shit
Thats why they on my dick
Like them little tricks that I taught your bitch
Shed probably lick it if I unzipped these Dickies
You need to quit it, knock it off
Im in your girl ear like a cotton swab
And anythin I say, Im a blame it on that alcohol
Like T-Pain on a song with Jamie Foxx
Im here cause its my time, you came to watch
Every day its ceramics class, pass the pot
So what up Jay?
Shit nothing but the money
What you trying to say?
More fifties more hundreds
Who you trying to be?
Who I already is
King of my city, thats no pop quiz
Sitting in my Chevy smoking heavy on the best bud
Get it from the source
Got the best plug
Watts California be my city till the death bruh
You aint hearing that?
Then you deaf blood
Moving like a snail
You can catch a slug
Hit you like a snare
I got big drums
Hunt for every dollar
I just stack funds
Yours is insufficient
Thats why you mad huh?
Ever since I got a deal niggas hate me hard
So I keep a steel
Got no time to spar
Got no time to spare, money on my mind
Like hair
Like a flight of steps
All a nigga get is stairs
Big bag of green
Looking like a pear
When I hit a club
Im leaving with a pair
Nigga I dont care
Bitch Im a baller
Crash my whip today and cop another one tomorrow
So what up Jay?
Shit nothing but the money
What you trying to say?
More fifties more hundreds
Who you trying to be?
Who I already is
King of my city, thats no pop quiz
So what up Jay?
Shit nothing but the money
What you trying to say?
More fifties more hundreds
Who you trying to be?
Who I already is
King of my city, gotta get it how I live
Me without a dollar is like a scholar with no smarts 
That dont make sense dont it? 
Im in a Lamborghini with a Brazilian woman 
Miss Novocaine
Suck my dick till she numb it 
You fly like a plane
But Im more like a comet
Soaring over the atmosphere
I can hear the aliens cheer 
Victory is sweet my dear 
Heres the technique my dear 
And maybe you can duplicate me
Its weird how yall never can progress within the process
Of making residuals
I guess that you aint I yet
Try to interfere with the dinero that I get
Watch yall bear arms like women rub on my triceps duddy
Yall is funny to me
You thought I came by myself nope
Its money with me
Its the root of all evil, but the need of all people
Yours is frail
I weigh mines on Brannon Scales
So what up Jay?
Shit nothing but the money
What you trying to say?
More fifties more hundreds
Who you trying to be?
Who I already is
King of my city, thats no pop quiz

Cracks in your pocket

Dope in your pocket

You cant get caught with
So you might want it locked in
Cracks in your pocket
Weed in your pocket
Dope in your pocket
Who the hell could stop it?
Up against the wall, against the wall, against the wall
It was around two at night, I saw the blue and whites
There was one black officer and two were white
And Ill admit that I was wrong cause I blew the light
But I figured the black one was out to prove he white
And hed prove me right and wouldnt do me right
So when I rolled the window down he wasnt too polite
Matter fact, he was screaming at the top of his tonsils
I said, Sir, theres no need to be this hostile.
Well, Mr. Cons, you got late registration
I said, Its me, Cons, from Late Registration
He looked at me like I aint take my medication
And this was the cause of his detonation
He told me, Step away from the vehicle
This is becoming way too much to read into
He called for back-up, so whatd you expected me to do?
To stand there like a horse at a feeding zoo?
Nah, I did what my feet should do
I tried to bolt but then the white one put the nine millimeter to my throat
And told me, Freeze, or youll be risking it all
And thats how I wound up
Up against the wall, against the wall, against the wall
Cracks in your pocket
Weed in your pocket
Dope in your pocket
Who the hell could stop it?
Up against the wall, against the wall, against the wall
Yea, caught red-handed, ridin with the cannon
Schemin and scammin, livin like Reggie Hammond
A phantom, snapshots from the mans Canon
Pigs got my pictures on the wall like a parent
I be disappearin but the cameras
ll catch you doin dirt if you be careless
You gotta be more aware of it
To save yourself the embarrassment of gettin caught carryin
They hit me homie with calendars, he was talented
And Im still fightin cases out in Maryland and breakin up marriages
Like packages of white, like Marilyn
Still dabble in the crack game, baggin it
Feds in the palaces, searchin through the cabinets
Im a capitalist, get off that faggot shit
My establishment, thats rather fabulous
Police threw us in the paddy wagon like savages
Cracks in your pocket
Weed in your pocket
Dope in your pocket
Who the hell could stop it?
Up against the wall, against the wall, against the wall
Yea, this shit got me feelin kinda like Sunday evenin
On the pulpit, me and my heathens
Me and Consequence circle your seven continents all in one weekend
Make sure your proposal is decent, get exposed to treason
The last of the dyin Mohicans when mentionin rappers
My niggasll rat-tat-tat you, then kiss your mother right after
Disasterll strike faster than a thief in the night
The thesis of a black man, policemen never could write
Thats why our backs against the walls, gun raised
Takin out everything, like bank withdrawals before the year 2K
And by the end of the day, Ill be Americas most wanted
Shot and confronted while runnin from the CIA
Livin life as a rebel, the last Panther stuck in the ghetto
Tuckin the metal like junkyards and rockstars
The smoke never settles, where Im from
From a tree to the corner-stores is where we hung, uhh
Cracks in your pocket
Weed in your pocket
Dope in your pocket
Who the hell could stop it?
Up against the wall, against the wall, against the wall
Well uhh yeah

Back when I had worn my cousin’s shoes with holes and socks in it
Eatin top rhymin, walk to school with a prepaid cellular
Crackheads tried to sell me a stolen Sox fitted
I tend to look at my upbringing a lot different
From where I’m at I inform you like Armonax that I’m two levels of terrific
Ya dumb bitch
We in yo hood with the transmissons, ya dumb bitch. Yee!
See this is Compton at its best, your four-o
And I’m loco as an esé with a fo-loco

Verse 1
Living life without an answer
And unsolvable questions
Hoping God will hear our prayers
As we sit here and listen
But Oh No!
I guess this life for us is tragedy
Believe in me
I try to make us see the image that we want to see
And if we help the damn U.S
But we aint even treated with the same respect
Explain that!
My brothaz on crack
They try to fight back
Drug convinced
So you know that they aint never fight back
My sistaz on knees
They wanted yall to see
A good women of Hmong
Live in communities
But yall was too blind to realize
So fuck off
Dont let me change my damn mind
With Real lies
And if we plead
To what we believe

Showing all my fellow gooks
Showing that we real we true
So keep your fist high and fight for your life
They say life is a test but are they right
Trouble seems to be attached to us like magnets
No time to wait for homos & faggots
Just live your life & just love it
Cause most of us will never make it
Only take some to say it
So take this opportunity and take it
I promise you Youll need it
No time to even waste it
With all these hesitation
And muthafuckaz complaining
We own this muthafuckin game
So rep Hmong All the way
And say H.M.O.N.G Nigga, Yeee!

Bu parçayı yerden 30 bin feet yüksekte yazdım
Hostes sert saçım üzerinden bana iltifatta bulunuyor
Eğer onu bütün bu yolcular karşısında becerebilseydim
Beni muhtemelen bir terörist sanarlardı
Kuşkonmazımı yiyin, sonra hostese genç bir zencinin düşüncelerini soruyorum
Hızlı gelen para ve özgürlük
Bir dolar için kaza kuklalığı, biliyorum onunla tanışmak için can atıyorsun

Bir sürtüğe sürtük, bir kaltağa kaltak ve bir bayana bayan derim
Asfaltın üzerindeyken yeri kırmak dışında bir şey yapmadım
Lastik izleri sana bir şimşek hızı ile satış yaptığımın kanıtlarını verir
Bir çocuk olarak iki yetişkin öldürdüm, ben çok gelişmişim
20 li yaşlarımı 2 yaşımdayken yaşadım, akıllı adam
Gerçeği söylemek gerekirse 87 yaşında gibiyim
80 din adamı kadar kötüyüm
Alev dolu bir havuzda şeytanın elini tutuyorum
Bir mesafeden bakınca hangisinin Hristiyan olduğunu ayırt edemiyorum, kahretsin

Kimseye, kendime bile güvenemem
İkizler yardım çığlığı atıyor

Alpha Male & The Canine Mystery Blood
Came to town with Death Cab for Cutie
I stayed home with my wife and child
And a six pack of beer
I pondered that name for 15 minutes
After I saw the poster stapled to a phone pole
On the corner of Grand and 21st
That was a couple of years ago
I was already in my forties then
So I didnt go out on a whim just to see
A band called Alpha Male & The Canine Mystery Blood
Just because I liked the name
Just because Im 25 and every days a stoned summer day
My bands always giggin then
REM was still kickin then
I drove that Ford Grenada Mom and Dad gave to me
After they got em a Ford LTD
And there was music on MTV
I smoked my managers pot
And got laid quite a lot
Planes hadnt flown into towers yet
And we didnt have a loose cannon president
We didnt have all this credit card debt
Hangin over the house like a cloud
Ensurin theres not much more druggin allowed
A body wont take it, wallet cant hang
Singin all the songs Ive sang for years
And when its a band gig its rockin
And when its solo the people are talkin while Im singin
Make me depressed, you think I could take a hint?
My time came and went
Hell theres many nights I came and went
In a manner of speaking my conscience is sleeping
The world is changing the good times are gone
We get to be the folks who greet the dawn
Of an age of distrust, surveillance and sleaze
And bombs in shoes and way too many enemies
I bet their name was Menstrual Blood
And the A&R guy said Thats no good
Make it Mystery and then we can target
A broader base of Goth dog lover market
I love my boy, hes becoming a drummer
Got a drum kit from Santa, at this rate by summer
Hell be keepin a beat in a world that needs a metronome
Shoved up its ass so hard that
All voices will raise in the heavenly choir
Shitll get straight, brothers will hug
Well dance like we did in the decades of drugs
Im spittin my genes in an ocean thats risin
Clingin to Jesus with some compromisin
Of how it was handed to me from my mom
And my daddy the preacher who watched all that TV
In a cream recliner
Scroungin through life like a stoned hardliner
You couldnt faze him, he knew Jesus
Died for his sins and was raised from the dead
And Ive always wondered, why cant he stay dead?
It doesnt change any good thing he said
What matters is his life and not how he died
Why cant he just be a nice Jewish guy?
Who was super clued in and showed us the way
To salvation from sin
And that doesnt mean that youre not quote-unquote saved
You fry like a piece of country ham in your grave
Its a great big world, life is a joke
Arabs and Christians, Pepsi and Coke
People so gorgeous it causes em pain
And nobody gives any sympathy for something like that
You suffer in silence or form a band
With a name that appeals to Goth dog lovers everywhere
On a poster thats seen by a forty-ish bastard
Walkin to work at 8:15
$11 an hour for all that he does
Cant be a has-been if you never was
Goin all day long without eatin
Till all my nerve endings are seriously overheatin
I get wobbly walkin down the stairs
To smoke me a cigarette in the cold fresh air
Wonderin why I do the things I do
And I do em every day
And it cant turn out good livin this way
But live this life I must and
In some fuzzy God I trust
Ill kiss my wife, Ill kiss my son and
Maybe someday Ill go for a run
Maybe someday a song will stick
Ill walk around like I got a big boat
Maybe someday my boyll drum in a
Hippie jam band that plays out some
Hell take after Daddy, get in the van
Go somewhere only young people can
Doing things only young people do
Bangin those skins at Bonnaroo
Rockin the dreadheads, dancin in the mud
Before Alpha Male & The Canine Mystery Blood
God go with him, Amen
Uh, Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
Goddamn I feel amazin, damn, Im in the Matrix
My mind is livin on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and – vroom-vroom! – Im racin
Poppin pills in the lobby and I pray they dont find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hatin, shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ, if I live life on my knees aint no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Churchs Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screamin—
All my lifе I want money and power
Respеct my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches: wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers
Ive got 25 lighters on my dresser, yessir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldnt measure
And it make me cum fast, but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what Ive been wantin since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rollin, Im holdin my scrotum and posin
This voice here is golden, so fuck yall, I goes in, and—
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches: wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or, nigga, its go time
I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run at ho with a baton
Thats a relay race with a bouquet
They say, K, you goin marry mines.
Beeotch! No way, beeotch! No way
Beeotch! No way, beeotch! Okay
Im never livin life confined
As I feel you even if Im blind
I can tell you who, what, when, where
How to sell your game right on time
Beeotch! Go play, beeotch! Go play
Beeotch! Go play, beeotch! I look like OJ
Killin everything from pussy to a mothafuckin Hit-Boy beat
She pussy poppin and I got options like an audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win, then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city, mobbin in the street, yellin—
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers

Everybody think they can rap, and everybody starting they record labels and everybody pushin out they songs And if thats what yall wanna do, go hard. But what separates our company from their company?
Consistency, man. You know, just, you know, perfect your craft, man. Try to block out all that other shit, man, just worry about your craft. Business, and the business will fall in place

Yeah we gone keep it moving man
Your man DJ Skee holdin it down
With my man Jay Rock
Next fuckin superstar of the West Coast
Remember where you heard it first
You can tune in to him, on my radio show
You know we always playin his shit
Saturday nights, Channel 40
Hip-Hop nation, satellite radio, lets go
It aint nothing for a soldier to bleed
Takes a real gangsta to squeeze 
Only the strong survive, you see
Plus the strong dont cherish the weak 
It aint nothing for a soldier to bleed
Takes a real gangsta to squeeze 
Only the strong survive, you see
Plus the strong dont cherish the weak 
Pull up in the whip, identical black
Two bitches inside, identical racks
Two guns on my side, identical gats
Leave a nigga bleeding fast in need of a pad
Look, when a nigga broke, in need of some cash
Ill hit a house fast, with the heat and a mask
All fingers on triggers, itching to blast
Everybody on the floor, yelling Wheres the stash?
 then Im out split second to dash
Swerving through enemy lines might bust me a cap
Then I pull the car over throw the strap in the trash
Make sure the coasts clear, no signs of the crash
Only the strong survive, when I speak it its real
Dawg its real on this field, get killed for the skrill
Got ice on your hand, get killed for your chill
Killer Cali you bastard, keep you a steel
Pull out the Aston Martin
If you talking too much pull out my coffin
Pull out another one for his brother
Real comfortable, even get his favourite colour
I burn rubber off the V12
I fuck international females
My last bitch bitch was speaking some German shit
Catch me vacating on the Germany trip
Eyes red, sandals on like, fuck what Camron said
Im pecking for the bread
But nothing like a pigeon
Im something like a vulture
You wanna know how I do it mothafucka Ill coach ya
They call me Phil Jackson
I train your day like Denzel, welcome to practice
Yes Im the baddest, if my lyrics had looks
This rhyme right here belong in the beauty pageant
J. Brown asked me do I got it, been had it
This beat is pornographic
I fuck off it
Enemy down, left his ass spread apart
Trying to get back to the whip, fuck it wont start
Now Im on foot back to the turf
Disguised in these colours of this nigga I murked
Hide in the bush, hit the bitch on the chirp
This where Im at, dont let the ones get here first
So as she pulled up, I jumped in the Magnum
Took my clothes off and burned em, after I bagged em
I shoot shots through your new era
Have your face airbrushed on a all white new sweater
Before the judge say youre 
Im jumping out, dumping, let him kill me in a stand off
Please , take me away
At least back behind the car I fire back with the K
Thats what it is, fire back where you stay
I spent my whole life trying to climb back with the yay
Oh oh oh oh... oh oh oh oh
Hey hey hey hey...hey hey hey hey
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright...
Hey...hey.... Kendrick Lamar
Im feeling like a motherfucking animal, Hannibal Lecter 2012
Elected to execute every rapper than has excelled
If music you callin, then you ball it, pick up your cell
If a nigga said he could see me, bet he told you in Braille
Fucker, put you on front street and buy some bread
Nigga you lunch meat, you shoulda worked at Subway instead
Goliath couldnt bear my triumph
Im a leader, walk behind me as I walk through Zion
Swing your swords like Im sparring with a Spartan
Make they face drop when the beat drop, I drop a rare jewel like a Martin
Fool man courage, balling like PeeWee Kirkland
Call him a Kirk Franklin, stomp em and leave em hurting
No judgement for the plaintiffs, they tried to find me guilty
Of as spitting as filthy as ODB, but Ive been OD
Since 03 thats march 14th, my first recordings
I kicked it like Wheat Thin musical Chuck Norris
Im a maniac
Aint no telling where they pay me at
The sky cant see where Im aiming at
Wherever Im at, thats where danger at
Looky here boy... Im a maniac
Aint no telling where they made me at
Run up in your crib, where the paper at?
You the nigga, fine, you better pay me that
Looky here boy...
Nigga wake up, go on and shut your face up
Get your little ship sunk, fuck it with an anchor
Go on, get your cake up, so you can step your weight up
Get your little plate crushed, fucking with a bassa
Serve niggas like waiters, straight no chaser
Scissors, Glock, shoot for that paper
Wake up, when I was 17, it was money over everything
Perfected the craft, made this a cheddar thing
Carried on the dream like Coretta King
Standing outside the door until they let us in
Niggas only hustle to get better things
Still the Feds mark us like Lady Eloise
Im getting Starbucks, little vanilla bean
If you pull that thing, than you better squeeze
Me and K.Dot wiling in the street, Rott-
Weiler, no collar, we clear the place out
If you dont want that trouble than turn your face round
Lay you flat like treble, we pull the bass out
You know who definitely in the place now
Real niggas up in this bitch, we send the fake out
Oh oh oh oh... oh oh oh oh
Hey hey hey hey...hey hey hey hey
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright...
I can see what your thinking, my vision is intrusive
This is pure, untapped energy in the music
Insane with the pen Im deranged
A maniac untamed, fighting through guards in every line, its a cage
Maniacal, mad man of the day, nobodys safe when Im wanting
Sniping niggas like John, keep out on my hundred
You haters hunted, how lyrical you want it?
My action is irrational, whenever confronted
Yours true to the left brain, bullied my mind fully
Automatic, your filters are off killing reality
Make casualties out of these rappers, based on fallacies
Blood thirsty, ready for more murking
Reading my genius in my narratives, between first and third person
Out of the box swerving, thoughts oxygen
Im all precise on it, a poison-tipped archer
With the conviction of a martyr
A maniac like a felon going off of their water
Oh oh oh oh... oh oh oh oh
Hey hey hey hey...hey hey hey hey
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright...
Im the only nigga doin it, you other niggas ruined it
Im too legit, go Hammer wit the foolishness
My nana said my grammar can maneuver this industry
Until Im stupid rich and now Im stupid rich, ah

It is light that I shine, it is bright in my mind, then I write them in rhymes, tighten every line, on the mic I will shine
And I know Nottingham will wish I was raised there
But in the Noosphere to me, it was made clear
Why my birth was the first of the year according to the new world calender
The birth of the new world challenger
My smirk aint a compliment, nah its a challenge bro
Your work must be relevant, theres must be talent bro
Got my eyes on the game like d screen of a monitor
Good morning world

High above the sky you cant come up dis high
Never sold crack but i want a piece of the pie
And yeah I came to the world through the ports of England
Third hour of day three, I reached the cosmos region
A son of the dawn, the sun to the moon, Ousama Saddam
The Enemy you hate, the energy you take
From enmity youve made is eminently a waste wait ...
Now back to this joint
Back to putting them niggas on point

Or Imma just lie, base on a truth, but there is no truth, based on a lie
Boy am killing this bitch, she aint killing my vibe
Yea I gotta kill this bitch before she kills my vibe

Will do anything for the game am 3T
They cant wait to televise me on 3D

Snoring on me then wake the fuck up
The slept-on ones are stepping the fuck up
I know you hear the twist in the beat
The cords of the Kora, the strings of Africa
The cores of the Torah, stems from Africa
Keep this shit on repeat
I aint paid for the beat so I need no receipt
See my man MoudSound emailed me the beat
And these bitch ass dudes looks like female to me
Bilingual kid spitting from English to Twi

Riding around, face bright, sunshine
I feel a bit tough, excitement
Care too much but dont feel like trying
What else should I be trying?
Should I tell her that Im caring, rap about six flaws or maybe seven
Scary hiding from my problems
You not a problem but if you are we can solve it together
Write a few letters
Make a state together, dont change like the weather
Leave for good, or worse cause right now
Of course youre the stores favorite
Dont change at all just here me saying
Words that sound cheesy
Everyday at Mcy Ds with a burger or cheesy fries to match

My day one motherfucking fans in this building, one time. As I look around-this the shit. I aint been this intimate in a long time. We might be up here all motherfucking night, I got something. I aint seen yall in a minute, real shit. You know I mean it when I say, I been around the world and shit. A whole sea of people. But nothing like coming right here in front of this small group. The people thats been with me since day one. Kendrick Lamar EP. Kendrick Lamar OD. Section-mothefucking-.80. Real shit. This is cool right here goddamn, this is really cool right now. This about real shit, listen up. To Pimp a Butterfly. People said a lot about this album. Thatd said album of the year, that said album of this generation and all that shit. Thats cool, but also real shit making this motherfucking album was therapy. Not only for you, but for me, You know what Im saying? Because within six months of good kid, m.A.A.d city dropping, the life of what I knew, when I knew what it was, thinking I knew, that completely changed within six months. And uh, you going through the motional of the world telling you that youre great. And you trying to make yourself believe that shit, but its hard because youre institutionalized from where you come from. Still trying to move around and stay the way I like I do. Im a low-key nigga. And I aint scared of the world. Me personally, I cant run around with a hundred niggas like I usually do. I dont need to, I dont want to. And thats just been me since day one. So trying to grasp the idea of them telling you who you should run with, it cant cut it. Because like I said on the Kendrick Lamar EP, I need to be me goddamnit. I think this shit can live forever, but looking at yall faces yall just. I got some of the most loyal. dedicated motherfucking fans in the world . I could talk all day . To Pimp a Butterfly. Yall allowed this motherfucking album has soared all the way to the top with no motherfucking commercial success. Yall allowed it to be top-tier without a constant radio single and shit. So that proves to you right there, music is not something you can motherfucking market all the time. This shit belong to you and you only, you know what Im saying? Some shit that y’all can feel whether you insecure, whether you vulnerable, whether you mad, happy, angry, sad. You pop this motherfucking tape in, you pop your favorite music in, and you love and you live that shit. And you allow artists like me myself to come back to these group of people and perform the shit that I want to perform, you dig what Im saying? This may be the first and last time I perform To Pimp a Butterfly on this run. Eight of the ten cities. And I made sure New York be one of them cities that I come back to to do this shit. So with that being said, we gon rock this shit until the casket drop or until, until it all falls down. Lets go

Roaches on the corners of cul de sacs

Oh, okay, okay. I understand that. Okay, now, for uhh people who dont know, whered you grow up at, man? Like, you know, what type of city. What area?
Uhh, Compton. Straight Compton. No sides. No - just - niggas used to roll down Rosecrans, we used to be bumpin that - pops used to be bumpin that NWA shit. And, uh, shit - you know, cruise down that street in my 6-4. We wasnt in no 6-4 though. We was in the brown dukie van and shit, same color as dukie
Know what Im talkin bout? But uh, yeah, wed bump that shit all day
Oh, okay. And what influenced you to become, you know, a rapper?
You know, the typical person would say, uh, other rappers. Imma be straight up honest, when I found out I was dope - Next question...
So you’re performing in Brixton on Monday, what happens at one of your live shows?
Craziness. A lot of energy, a lot of energy from myself and the crowd
How do you feel in front of a crowd?
I feel at peace, you know. It’s a way to express yourself, a way to vent, put all your emotions out on that stage
Where was your first ever gig?
My first ever was at a hole in the wall place, in a small city, in a small club in Los Angeles
What happened?
I was probably terrible.. But it was a growing experience, a growing process, and you know, you never forget those moments
Who was the first person to tell you that you were good at music?
The first person to tell me was probably this guy named Dave Free, he’s my manager now, since I was like tenth grade...yeah
How did he discover you?
Through a mutual friend, it was all in high school, rapping and stuff. And then a mutual friend told him about me and we decided to start doing music and we’ve been doing it ever since
How did he help you to develop your sound?
He really just allowed me to experience different things in music, and listen to different people, he got a broad playlist in music everybody from west coast, to the east coast. And basically we just started developing there
You said in an interview before that your mum told you that whatever you do, you just gotta do it really, really well. What does she make of your success now?
Oh yeah, she loves it. She sees that I took heed in what she was saying because you have people that’s calling me the best at what I do, and you know l pride myself in that. She always said that whatever you do make sure that youre the best at it
What kind of a son were you when you were younger?
I was a good son, respectful, I never disrespected my mother, I never disrespected my father intentionally. Probably some of the things I did, outside of the house were a little bit outlandish, but as far as verbal disrespect or inner presence disrespect, never, so, I was a good son
What are your earliest memories of their music?
A lot of oldies, gangster rap was played in my household, which really inspired my sound today from new melodic driven, aggressive type feel
What track or album have you listened to more than any other?
That’s hard, that’s tough. They played a lot of 2Pac All Eyez On Me, Me Against The World, they probably played that track a hundred thousand times in our house
How did the collaboration with Drake happen?
I went on his Club Paradise tour and we really built a bond, a relationship, since the first time we met. He put me on his album, which was the interlude, red light interlude, we always said it was gonna work, it was just about finding the right song, that was the right song
What happened in your first meeting with Dre?
I was very excited, I wasn’t nervous at all. I was more excited, cause I knew that this was my shot, everything that lve worked for, everything I’ve built up to came down to that moment
What happened in that moment?
That moment I recorded my first song with Dre, which was Compton, which is the last song on my album
Do you speak to him on a daily basis?
Yeah I talk to him
And what’s he up to at the moment?
At the moment he’s just working his Beats by Dre. Doing a lot of promo and press for that, getting buried in life right now
Can you see yourself moving to projects outside of music like he does with Beats?
Yeah definitely. You know when you conquer one thing, you want to move on to the next and be able to challenge yourself? He inspired me to want to do that, once l get the years behind me, of being exceptionally great at music
Are you creative in other ways outside of the music?
Yeah. Im very hands on with the whole visual and concepts beyond the music
Are you a competitive person?
Very competitive
So where does success lie?
Success lies in challenging myself, thats where l get my success
And how will you ever be fulfilled?
Probably when l see that my music has touched more people than l can possibly imagine, and that point in time will come
What do your lyrics say about you as a person?
My lyrics say that I have morals, say that I have confidence, say I have weaknesses, say I have strong points, say l am a human being
What are the morals that you live by?
Treat others the way you want to be treated. That’s the number one, that’s something that my mother always told me. That’s the one piece of advice I would give everybody and the world would be a better place
Can you tell me about the picture on the front cover of the album?
The front cover really represents the lifestyle that I’m used to, the coming up, seeing a lot of parties, a lot of good times, a lot of bad times and really I blanked the eyes out so that you see the innocence, the little boy that’s in there, which is me. No matter what he is around, you still see the vulnerability in this kid, you know that he wants to figure out whats going on around him
Do you think your music comes from a positive place?
Yes. My music comes from a positive place, only because I was once in a dark place before in my life so, to actually get to that positive space you have to come in this negative world, where you’re striving to do something better for yourself
How did you allow those negative situations to not affect you, or jade you?
Just knowing something was bigger than me, something was bigger than just Compton, something was bigger than the trouble we were getting ourselves involved in, I knew something was more, and l wanted more for myself. Not only for myself but for the people l care about
Are you still based in Compton now?
No, I’m a rolling stone. I don’t have a place to stay. Im roaming the world
What do you do with all your stuff?
My mother has all that stuff. I’m in the world now, I like to see other things. Cause for so long when youre in Compton, its all you think that exists, so when I finally got out to see other places, like London, it makes you want to continue the travel
When youre travelling what are things you have to have with you at all times?
Fresh pair of drawers, fresh pair of socks
How have you been enjoying London?
I love it. Y’all weather’s a bit gloomy right now, I like gloomy weather, I work best and do most of my album under gloomy weather, so you’ll hear a lot of dark tracks in there
How are British fans different to your US fans?
Theres a little bit more excitement with British fans, a little bit more energy, I think you guys just appreciate a little bit more
Out of all the tracks you have written, which do you feel the most proud of now?
The most proud of is tough, Ive written a lot of tracks. If it had to be from this album, any one off this album really, sing about me, l’m real, Compton
From the previous mixtapes, are there any songs that you’ve written that you find difficult to listen back to now?
What’s crazy is that l don’t listen to none of my older music, just because I always wanted the team to grow. I don’t wanna get caught back in that time, or critiquing what i should have done or what sounds right
Who will you collaborate with in the future?
I’m really tight on collaborations, I always say Erykah Badu, that’s it for now, that’s always in the back of my mind
Two emcees, thats all we need
This a freestyle off of the top, proceed
I come from the West
You know I gotta get em
Flow sicker than cancer in Manchester
Yes-ugh
As we rock from off the top
You know I got the sure shot
I make it hot
I go from Compton to Watts to the suburb-ian-ghettos
If you want to see me everybody say hello!
Yo!, give me that motherfucking mic back
Tryna battle
Ill put your little ass in the saddle
How you dont see before
You cant see me
Never better emcee thats fucking shorter than me
Yo, yo
Im-ma use that mic
Im-ma do that right
Im-ma spit this all day and all night
Anybody wanna come under pressure?
Anybody wanna see God-bless ya
I love ya fro, you got the head of the future
Rocky, good kid, mad city 
I was there-ah
Now I had to switch it up and get the braids
Now I had to come through
Flow sicker than AIDS
I gotta get paid, I gotta get laid
I gotta come true, gotta be real
I gotta be proof, gotta be you
Gotta be us and gotta be due
Step up, emcee
If you want time right now
Come right now
And shine! 
Hold up!
I gotta leave yall with at least a few bars
Its not about the women, the money, stars, and cars
Its not about the clothes, the hoes
Know who we are
Its all about the mentality
Love making chords
Your life makes you bruised and battered
But that dont matter
If you wanna know
Fuck all that chitter-chatter
Do your thing, let em sing
Let the gun-boy reign
Bite the sound, I just came and blazed

Maybe Im just a fool
Do you think of me?
Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that Im not around?
My friends are actin strange
They dont bring up your name

Straight from the bottom of the gutter
Where we run from undercovers
Like a tiler who dont want to take a nap, my brother
Wavin for a rap, my brother
I was broke, goin half on a set, my brother
Twistin up the purple, call it jelly roll
Incarcerated till Im faded, let it feed my soul
Daydreamin bout Keyshia Coles
Look to my left, see a rat with a snotty nose
Yeah, thats the type of shit Im on
This is where I come from, this is where I was rose
But the floors dont got those
Just heroin needles that stick you in your shoe sole
And you can get your shoe stole
Rockin Jordans like you important, give me those
I want the victory to picture me
I can write or recite scriptures from Timothy
Dreams of this paper, dreams of this paper
Ridin round with my middle finger up in the scraper
Middle finger up to my motherfuckin haters
Im so serious, but I laugh at you later, aye
I aint never lie, I aint never lie
I aint never lie, I aint never lie
I aint never lie, I aint never lie
I aint never lie, I aint never lie
Straight up, this aint no fuckin fluke
I got homies right now with choppers on the roof
I got bitches right now with deuces in they boots
Blades in they hair, so if they chop it up with you
That mean literally, they gone chop you up through
Shh, so dont get too comfortable
Like Wayne and Babyface, Im a fuckin fool
Got these streets on lock like a 
Watch, Im a Monsoon, Typhon times two
Nine times out of ten Im ridin with the rifle
For my rivals plottin on my arrival
Take a break, I take a AK and a smile
You take a breather, take a ounce of the reefer
Straight to the head, keep the heater, you aint ether either
Plus, I had the scale like a libra
Weighin up, but Im a Aries, so I ram em till they buried
Dreams of this paper, dreams of this paper
Ridin round with my middle finger up in the scraper
Middle finger up to my motherfuckin haters
Im so serious, but I laugh at you later, aye
I aint never lie, I aint never lie
I aint never lie, I aint never lie

I aint never lie, I aint never lie

All over Every day
U reckon I should be getting paid Nigga!
Popping an addy right after bukkake
Nut all on your shawty n sippin that lean
N I’m poppin a bean smoking good weed
N I’m popping amphetimine
Oh god can someone save Kennedy
Playing a remedy play molly by playboi carti
I am so sorry
Been down on my luck
Like the old days
Sippin lean poppin beans lucid dreams
Listening to cordae
I’m a fucking addict I’m so dramatic
I’m The Problematic this life I lavish
I roll up 
I go up 
Drop the top 
Lick the spliff roll the lick Put it between my lips n I lit the bic
Smoke the pain away
Every Friday 
Nothings gonna change
When you on top getting fame
N You made it outta the hood
So you could be good
N Yo habits on a loop
Saying pull up in the coupe
But you still on that bad shit
So you finna pull up in a casket
I don’t care if it’s for better or for worse
All I know is a famous man with wise words
Saying we all get a death we deserve
But it’s your life you can preserve
Hating tweets saying kill yourself
You laugh as you grab the pills on the shelf
They saying you ain’t the best
I’m scared of the day that I move out
It’ll turn dark no sun Just black clouds
Stay inside just to make a good sound
After I say goodbye and give a big hug
Drove to the chemist to get my drugs
Prescription for Ritalin 
Thank god I’ll be taking them
Driving down to the crib
Creating a new adlib
Grabbing my laptop reclining my seat
Kicking up my feet trynna make a beat
Wanna prove everybody wrong
By blowing up off a perfect song
Popping an addy to gain my powers
I’ll down a huned by the 2nd hour
Forgetting to eat and sleep
Fuck I’m still stuck on this beat
Still felt lost so I looked it the box
I needed more Ritalin
Texted a kid who was selling em
200 for a box I didn’t give a fuck
I popped about 50 more
I didn’t feel well I fell to the floor
N I went down in mystery
Now no one remembers me
Jesus all this just to be stuck in history
Cause no one believed in me
I overdosed because I wanted to be the best of all
They doubted that I’ll ever make it this far
I’m shitting on them now cause I was piss poor
Swear you down to kill with that steel
But that steel don’t make you real
If you can’t even win a fist war
So fuck it, I shoot back at you cowards
Your death the pastor announces
Because we acting on violence
It’s either that or keep silent
Always testing nigga back and back on a challenge
So what’s your choice?
It’s kill or be killed, what?
This life for me was given
It’s pimping or prisons
Visits over missions of your digits
Getting questioned, for nothing
So where you from, you fucker
We busting over discussion
It’s justice to get concussions, huh
You asked for it, might as well get cashed for it
Price is on your head now it’s leaking from the dashboard
Cold world, so keep a heater
If you never trust in Jesus, let me make you a believer!
Meet him
Cause you would do the same
Take aim at niggas brains
And wouldn’t care of no one names
I shot ak’s, handguns and shotguns
Justify your pride, I would stand I would not run, I got mine
Your heart is cold and there’s no one to run to
I grab my gun, cause that’s how I know to protect you
Street justice, street justice, street justice, street justice
This is my life, and that’s how I’m gonna protect you
Street justice
This is dedicated, 25 summers I waited
Back when papa was sedated, uncles all incarcerated
25 cousins to play with
Also 2 grandmas I played with
One had died, one moved to Vegas
Both had died, I started raging
Back when LA get the laces
With the blue sprinkles and …
Only broke our concentration
We was broke but mama saved enough
To keep refrigeration stocked
With cut noodles and baken …
The black car was the first to watch
Black boy, first to drop
Then my homie, the first to shoot
Then his homie, the first to drop
So look homie, my best pursuit
Is music, this was finalized
When I seen the devil eyes in that Buick
I was hypnotized
War going on outside, nobody safe from
Kicking your door to ask you where you get your safe from
Kick you some more, you ask me where I get my hate from
Compton, baby, Afghanistan, this is phase one
Compton, … new talibans, central raise one
Rosecrans street tell them coppers get off me, day’s done
Got darker than Alfred mayweather
Never been so cold, 2 sweater and a long nose, they stressing
When the world is cold and there’s no one to run to
I grab my gun, cause that’s how I know to protect you
Street justice, street justice, street justice, street justice
This is my life, and that’s how I’m gonna protect you
Street justice
We all like Gingis khan, everyone think they can just become
The punishment of god, but problems never get solved
All the way from Compton’s corner out to Oakland shake it hard
I get a woody wearing hoody, before your eyes just…my marks
And bullets hiding lyrics from myself and Ken Lamar
In the middle of this war, we made it out to be star
Cop cars never came with good cops
I gotta keep it cop just for my neighborhood watch
Street justice
Your heart is cold and there’s no one to run to
I grab my gun, cause that’s how I know to protect you
Street justice, street justice, street justice, street justice
This is my life, and that’s how I’m gonna protect you
Street justice
Yeah
I aint gon waste no time for these beggars
Look
At first sight, you thought my record was spam
Why give me a spin like a phantom become a fan?
You prolly workin on a mixtape of your own
You prolly reached out to get me on a song
But I aint holla backs, you feel like Im full of shit
You might even consider comin up with a diss
And I only encourage that if you want a cease to exist
You niggas search for the hits, Im just markin off my list
And if I had one wish
All of yall would disappear with the flick of a risk
I figure shit, the game is overpopulated with ball
You need a thug war, bro, for the stunts yall pour
But in this day and age, you cant mix the way that enter
And who needs attention if it aint in descender?
And yeah, Im a sinner like everybody else is
So I wont need your help long as God will forgive her
Im so bossy, bitch, get off me
Trick, get off me, I learned from wise men
I read the newspaper over cigarettes and coffee
And they only interests is benefits on war street
And you look up to niggas movin bricks in the OT
But you aint about shit, thats what dude Dogg taught me
No sixes on sprees but a bucket on 
But one missin on the driver side, and I love that, uh
When I rode through the city, it give me a rush
Yeah, Im high off life but Im rollin blunts
Big boss stick broads, it might scroll em up
Short shot like when its open, what?
I see you scopin, we should 
Im stonin like a straight out the coursin
Marchin, I put on for my soil, plant the seed
 ever seen
So if I happen to leave, just preferred to leave
With no college, Im still cold, droppin degrees and all
Everything aint what it seems
But theyre all actors, they belong in a scene
But no scholar, payin homage to Curtis King
Cause I a dream
I wonder if niggas like will ever make it big as Jigga
For bein a lyricist and not a pretender
You tend to niggas to surrender
Cause when I return like inter, Ima end ya
See I was mentored, filled around the ignorance
That young boy kick it like all three inches
Legend on the block, shout out to legend in block
And when it get greasy, I just call, been greasy
Easy, ask ScHoolboy about my group
Smoke up all this weed and dont drop one hoop
Tryna make moves, but punch keeps sayin
That patience is virtual and its maybe true
But I cant wait to rain like a hurricane came through
Get this woman and if yall cant get it then
Ima just for Kendrick, yeah
Uh, straight out the gate, I represent for heavy, section eight
House in the comfort, theres more to accomplish
The bomb, Hiroshimas atomic
My palm over the book of Psalms, promise to God I keep it honest, mind
Over matter, my subject matters, I land mines
Im on a bubble like a 
My hustle got Nipsey on his toes
We bout to pimp that game like a book of Chico
Word to Roc and Ab-Soul
ScHoolboy Q, money longer than any jewel
Thats how we tryna get it and if you say you got it
Im sure you gotta take it back like in the price cause its winnin
We all , youre all bitches, no pun intended
Yeah, yeah, Im bout to turn it up this year, bro
Bust it through your , they all wanna rock
I dont know if Im or a Guitar Hero
Ever since , new always seen these zeros
Trips overseas like a extra blood
Protection out cause I know they hate to show me love
My cause I like to really cook it up
Soufflé for , Lupe
Eminem and André
Weezy-F baby or any rapper out from the eighties
Im a 
They wanna put they money on me
Id rather to send them checks to 
Thats more important than me fillin your ass with poison
Quite frankly, you cant change me
So put me in your CD changer and admit its a banger
I admit Im a stranger to givin up
No exceptions make your girl famous for givin butts
Its eight-seven, hop in a to pet shop
Close your eyes, play track number five and see God
Copped the state of mind, thats the state of mines
I make my city make noise, you just make your moms
See the godfather, I could probably date your moms
Make Ab the godfather when I fuck a couple times, haha
Like call me Guitar Hero, or call me Dada
Sister days of Dada, I been on my shit, nigga
And you aint shit, nigga
Just shit on a and if they shit on my single
Ill be loadin up the nana clip, ready to mingle
I take it personal and now west DJ is the first to go
Not all level
Just somethin
Its a Polarbear beat, suckas
Ive been there, with my product of property
Visualize where it started, in that raggedy apartment, seein
Unit six ...
Cover the concrete, grass only grow in patches
One out of every five mothers had a crack habit
Three out of every five pops just up and vanished
Creating bastards who turn misfortune to magic
And morph pain into hip-hop classics
We the, ghetto messiah, spread our gospel through the bootleggers
Prosperity preaching the words reach foreign nations
I thank god for ... and Flash
And visionaries like Eric Wright and Dame Dash
Uncle Luke, J Prince and Russell
The players that turned dreams into million dollar hustles
Know that, without hip hop in my life I would probably be
On level 4 in the walls of the penitentiary
I still remember the first time
That I ever turned my boombox on
I just lay back and unwind
Whenever I turn my boombox on
Now whos that Puerto Rican 
Lyrically so committed I should be
Literally committed to a mental institution
Chasing satanic illusions, survived my step-fathers abuses
My music loosen nooses
Its proven Im ruthless, this dude is so ready to rumble
Aint playin with a full deck so please dont get caught in my shuffle
As a child living in the hovel Id mug you
To get a name ...
Got em like Im Saddam Husseins insane uncle
... no muzzle so erratic
Beef better keep it hidden like Schwarzennegars coke habit
Spilling my pain, psychological dark thoughts
Animal niggas should be walking on all fours
I spit it high, with the skill of a thief picking a lock
And a Benz full of bullshit like my MySpace inbox
My pen is a menace, I control the world in one sentence
West Coast stand up, Chino, Big Steele and Kendrick
Started drinking Saint Ides when I was knee-high
Still never look over the hill like Denzel in Book of Eli
Before 16 and Rick Rubin signed me
I turn on my boombox and imagine I was Cool J
God is good
I still remember the first time
That I ever turned my boombox on
I just lay back and unwind
Whenever I turn my boombox on
Welcome to my world
Back when Martin was the shit
And rocking ...
... bottles of Saint Ides
...
K was like nah, a young buck
Tryna find his outlet, coulda been an outlaw
Lil Wayne wasnt out yet, inspried by DMX
Inspired my first rhyme, glad to find a .49
I hadnt struck a gold mine
Yall done fucked up
My lyrics like BUCK BUCK
Then reload, then BUCK BUCK
Until he get FUCKED UP
Porno, lights, cameras, action
Im about to get it cracking like the ceiling in your grandmas attic
Bitch Im at it all night long
Hong Kong ... King Kong
And that means Im quick to stampede
On each and every song I be
Kendrick, expensive, lyrics out the ass
You smell what Im kicking, boomboxes I get wicked
Pull up...
I still remember the first time
That I ever turned my boombox on
I just lay back and unwind
Whenever I turn my boombox on
When times is crazy
I look at the stereo and it say, Play me!
Thats when I get 
Ohh, thats when I get 
You see, this is my story my pain
My struggle and fight
And when I wanna get away from life
I put my boombox on
Ohh, I put my boombox on
Ohh, ohh oh
Look, yeah
Fuck the critics
They dont know I spit it for the dub on my fitted
I wear it like a pendant
Rocks city don-dada
Who hotta?
Nada
L.A. crews, Mufasa
Shoutout to old crews, represent the same casa
West coast product 2009
They still trippin off the cest smoke
Show me a dime
Kill a pussy with my death stroke, every time
You best know, my style canal
I got the best flow
I stay with the pound, so Im good from the ground up
Let me take ya soul, I aint fuckin around
Nah, blood, cuz, or whatever
That get the shut up
Like Cheeto puffs
Keep bad boy os that we gon puff
Jay Rock what?
Top Dawg run the game let em know
Back by popular demands
Give it to you fresh out the kitchen
Pots, pans, hope my parents riches
Spit it like I had denchers
Suicidal thoughts, got me feelin like Sean Kingston
Hip-hop with precision
We talkin global
Perform global warming, ha
All them drops, I dropped a hundred down today
Yo mouth drop, top missin like a dropped toupee
Im goin through tracks like Jerome Bett-is
So fast you get whiplash or head-ache
Bars like Alcatraz, never been felon
But I spit it well to all the men in county jails
Dwell, on the fact that yo plummet record sales
Make you clumsy with the gat
Yo, Im so far ahead of my time
Finna lap my damn self
Im still in the hood, like a fan belt
The fan mail comin in bulk, hop on a bull
Every time you wanna see it reminds me of the flow
See notes like a treble clef
Step to the best and see why these niggas fall short
Like I tripped the dwarf from torn from a different cloth
Warned by a different boss
The art soon will make yall crumble
Im humble, but still anybody could get it
Fuck yall, this verse is sexually transmitted
Never timid, Im winnin like I got dibs on it
State of mind so large, we could all live on it
Start a new community...
I remain the winner, on my grizzy
Might even hibernate this winter
And Im still on some boss shit
Like, I dont care how much it cost shit
Yeah, nigga, Im a mack
So much pussy on the line, I dont know what the... snatch
Yeah, Ab-Soul light a match
Got the killa outside
Lets smoke ugh, K Dot, Compton city lyricist
Dont wack niggas, yeah I know they fearin this
Kendrick Lamar stopped by FADER offices recently in support of his major label debut, good kid, m.A.A.d city, out October 22nd on Aftermath/Interscope/Top Dawg. He declined to empty his pockets for a Things I Carry , but opened up about Barack Obama, being labeled a “conscious rapper” and Top Dawg Entertainment, the tight-knit label where he and the Black Hippy crew came up.
FADER: So tell us about the album.
Kendrick Lamar: It’s really just a self portrait. I feel like everything that people have asked me in interviews should be explained in this one album. How I’m able to think the way I think now—it had to come from a negative place first. Family issues, morals. All that is in one debut. I feel like it’s a whole new market of people that’s listening to me now, so it’s almost like a reintroduction to who I am and furthering that longevity.
F: Has being on a major label made things easier for you?
KL: It’s really just the same procedure. I’m still with this Top Dawg Entertainment company and we already ran this company like a major. Top Dawg: four individual kids off the streets, man, and really just gave them a domain to do something positive. We always did the work. We understood that if we wanted to be amongst the elite, we gotta conduct ourselves. So us joining forces with Interscope is basically a continuance of that, giving us an opportunity to do something constructive with ourselves, and the most positive high ever.
F: How’s it going with everybody? Ab-Soul’s album seems like it did well.
KL: I think every artist on the label is in a great space. We never wanted to present it as only one main artist in the camp. We wanted to solidify everybody as their own individual. That’s what’s happening now. You see Schoolboy Q’s taking off. Rock already been there and still working. Ab-Soul. Everybody’s making their own lane and their own path to where people can’t look at it as if Top Dawg Entertainment is Kendrick Lamar. It’s all of us as a collective that’s representing this company.Stream: Kendrick Lamar, “Backseat Freestyle” F: The album looks like a picture of you as a baby at a house party. What’s the story behind that picture?
KL: I think the people that’ll really understand the cover and the significance of every little piece in the portraits is people that’s been rocking with me since day one. Those are real portraits. They’ll understand what that means way before they hear the album. I’m sure that paints a big, big picture of what I represent, coming from this place, but it’s what I’ve been talking about, the lifestyle and putting a positive light on it at the end of the day.
F: That runs through so much of your music, this uplifting spin on things.
KL: There’s so much negativity in the world today. People know what’s real and know what’s fake. They know who really lived it and who’s trying to live it. That’s what I think people rock with me genuinely, because they know I’m not out here trying to glorify certain situations through these records or say I’m the biggest killer in the world. I don’t believe in none of these rappers anyway. The real gangsters, you never really see their faces because they’re either in the ground, in prison or behind the scenes.
F: What is people’s biggest misconception about you?
KL: Early on, when I started really getting attention, I seen a lot of blogs and a lot of media try to classify my music as one particular thing. That was like the “conscious” thing. It’s crazy, because they define it after just one project, certain things I was talking about. I never wanted that. I never want people to classify my music. That went out the window once I dropped a record called “Ignorance Is Bliss.” It was street, it was West Coast, it was a little bit more wisdom, and a person can’t really fake that. They figured out it wasn’t just the introspective side. At the end of the day, I want people to recognize me as just a human being, period. I talk about whatever I feel and whatever I go through.
F: What makes you happiest right now?
KL: It’s a few things. One, this influence I have on my community, on my city. I’m doing something in a positive light for these kids out here. A few of my homeboys, they’re locked up, they got kids and they’re going straight to jail as soon as they have these babies. Their sons, they’re five, six years old now. They’re looking at me to do something different. Their fathers respect that. So when their kid can see me on TV and get excited about it and know that I came from the same place they came from, that’s a great feeling to accomplish. That’s definitely a great feeling because I know it’s gonna start from that small place, that community in Compton, and eventually speed around the world. I wanna spark that idea in my own backyard first.
F: In another interview recently that you said you don’t vote. Has anyone given you a hard time for saying that?
KL: No. It was my own personal opinion and they know I’m true to myself. I’m not knocking the kids not to go out there and do it. Do it and get that experience. I gained that experience, it’s just a personal thing within myself and where I’m at in my life and how I feel about the world and spiritually. It has nothing to do with Obama. I want Obama to get that spot because I know he has a good heart. It’s just the people behind him. You have some people that say I’m in a space now where I disregard the people that are still struggling. That’s bullcrap, because at the end of the day, I’ve been thinking the same way since I was 16 years old. My whole thing is: people always look at the high places to come back down and help these communities, but at the end of the day, it starts with the people that’s in the communities. That’s what I really wanna stress.
Lyrics From Snippet
...gang 
Like  a chain more, this is purple rain
Young whippersnapper, hit you with my fucking aim...
...you youth listening side off, so hope
I  take chances, you throw tantrums
I  drop hits, you drop soap
And you plant it, Im romantic
Advances,  get checked on...
Sitting here thinking about how to get my money up today
Cause my change is looking a little strange
Maybe I should just go and rob a bank
And my shoes kinda old so I cant be on the run
Need to climb up on a cool million
Cause a 9 to 5 just aint an option
I need a get rich quick scheme
I need a get rich quick scheme
Im trying to live the American Dream
But the odds are against me
I need a get rich quick scheme
I need a get rich quick scheme
Im trying to live the American Dream
But the odds are against me
Empty envelopes deposited to the safe
Withdrawn as much as I could take
30 days late car no pass too
Ill park it somewhere else if its what I gotta do
1-800 numbers on my caller ID
Wont get a call til I hit the lottery
Im tired of living pity broke
As I promise all the levies that was in in o 
I hit the bank to withdraw the tellers tell me in o
I wanna have commas and live with common rich folk
You know the Oprahs and the Russells
With the hustle that can put me number six on the Forbes list
Ignore my troubles with a duffel 
Rick James screaming out, Im rich bitch
But for now Im just an average Joe
Drinking Kool Aid, boiling water, noodles on the kitchen stove
Gotta use them jumper cables just so my car cant get cut off
Every morning this is boring, you was touring, I was doing
Bad like Michael in the 80s with the curl 
Wishing I was balling out
Zipper open showing groins
Eating lobster looking proper helicopter
But for now I gotta rob ya
Let me tell you why I do this shit
Im a son of a gun cause moms was a Hoover Crip
First day I got signed I had to prove I spit
Freestyle with Busta Rhymes 
The protege of Doc Dre, I could finally put the shoes on
Now that the rumors of Rakim and Cube gone
They say truth hurts, sunk like quick sand
Dont stop me in traffic and ask about Hittman
I gotta restore the feeling that crawled from under the rock
After Tha Dogg Pound crushed the buildings
I got a family to feed, Im the middle of 9 children
We can talk about a loan after I sell 5 million
If I tell you I aint Game and I dont know Dre
You goin do me like Xzibit and cut half of my face?
I take all the credit for putting the west back on the map
If you aint feeling that, guess Im Guerrilla Black
Recognize my life
Ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright
Cause I want that shot, Im a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, Imma wreck it, even if my record dont pop
Imma tie a knot on a downtown building, let it tow behind me tell em
They can find me in the dark with the ghetto children look at my heart
Nigga fuck your feelings, this is me
Patty cake, patty cake, microwave
Suckas make a square, goddamn Im paid 
Im so cool, but Im so hot, and
Im, Im so fly, and you, youre so not 
Show me what youre workin with just like that 
Turn around, bend over, bring it back 
Snowman and Mannie Fresh bring it back 
Its Mannie Fresh and Snowman, its a wrap
Strapped up in the club, yeah Im so crazy
These other rappers actors like Patrick Swayze 
I tried to tell em but these niggas aint hearin me
Mossberg pump Im ridin shotgun literally 
Live from the projects, you know what it is
Ay, Snowman, , can I get a ad lib? 
Get the club crunk, cant take that from me
Aint dropped yet, still got Lil Jon money
I got million dollar dreams and federal nightmares 
We pop Cris my nigga, and still drink beers 
What did you expect man, I came from nothin 
Real street nigga and wouldnt change for nothin 
Got my niggas out the hood, its such a wonderful feeling 
Three car garage with the twelve foot ceilings 
It oughta be a crime just to feel this good
I swear it oughta be a crime just to be this hood 
Recognize my life
Ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright
Cause I want that shot, Im a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, Imma wreck it, even if my record dont pop
Imma tie a knot on a downtown building, let it tow behind me tell em
They can find me in the dark with the ghetto children look at my heart
Nigga fuck your feelings, this is me
Fresh wit the hustle so we bounce back on them suckers
Blowin big doin gigs got it ran in hundreds
They reppin layin here we stuntin
On the grind all the time homie gettin money
3rd Ward soldier 13th gangsta
17th hustler known top ranker
Money go getter them clowns cant figure
Poppin at the mouth like this cutter wont split em
Know how to survive hustlin stayin fly
My whole hood cried when my lil brother died
Know I had to ride never let it slide
Its just the G in me and Imma get it til I die daddy
Brush the platinum grab the straps homie make it happen
Comin through my neighborhood with 4s on the Caddy
Limo tints out the pound and Uptown crackin
Red bandanna duckin feds and the money stackin
Rest in peace to Miss Gladys like eeryday
We on the grind for the shine and we gon get paid
Spent a mill on the wheels custom wit the navi
2 of the same whips we doin it big livin lavish
Recognize my life
Ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright
Cause I want that shot, Im a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, Imma wreck it, even if my record dont pop
Imma tie a knot on a downtown building, let it tow behind me tell em
They can find me in the dark with the ghetto children look at my heart
Nigga fuck your feelings, this is me

Kids is what make me feel so good
See you looking at the glory thats coming up into the future of life
See the younger youth is whats gonna make everything to keep going
After I done passed down the hill
Young and black!
Uh, young, gifted and Im black
Uh, young, gifted and I rap
Young and gifted, but I dont got a strap
So I hope nobody try to run up on me with the mac
Like blat!
Lay a nigga flat
But let me fall back cause I aint into all that
As I get back to the trap
When I say Im trappin, that just mean Im tryna stack
Tryin not to get caught up where Im at
In the jects where the mice gettin cheese with the rats
Thats where I bes, and these is the facts
The world is a ghetto, we all know whos Geppetto
Angel on your shoulder, in your ear you got the devil
People change like leaves that them dope boys peddle
Blow trees like flowers in the meadow
Lifes a breeze, you know me, Im just tryin not to settle
Cause these streets still cold like metal
When its heat, it aint sweet
And them shots aint Jell-O
So, props to them niggas takin shots like Melo
From the block, just tryna meet the top like hello!
Uh, then we sayin our good-byes
Glory for the villains, no love for the good guys
A system of bad people thats tellin us good lies
Thats life as you know it, you lookin through hood eyes
Dont you know
That its true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Dont you know
That its true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Then theres a lot of funky things in this country
And theres a lot of good things too
But theres more funky than good
Weve changed some for the best
Awful lot of cases for the worst
And some, they have not changed at all
From a ghetto where fathers dont even father
Mothers dont even bother
Less its about a lotto
Do anything for a dollar
Yeah, they givin head just to get ahead
Provin they aint thinkin bout tomorrow
They bottle full of sorrow
Pain is deeper than cargo pockets
I wouldnt knock it, I just want better for my note
Yeah, I know we all different
But well always be the same til we change our endin
Man, we gotta change our mind before we change our livin
And if we never change our mind we in the same position
But niggas is niggas
And bitches, well, they still bitches
Instead of brothers and sisters
Man, this shit is ridiculous
I guess Im still ridiculous
Hollerin at shorty like hey, yo, let me get yo digits
Then a man get offended
Then a pistol get grippin
And he shoot and he missin
He dont care who he hittin
Another senseless victim
All from ghetto livin
Dont you know
That its true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Dont you know
That its true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Dude, we got to get our minds together!
Anytime a brother was shot another brother in his own neighborhood
Then go to his funeral and turn over his own casket
They need to have the police down there
Cause see the niggas is N.A.A.C.P
Niggas aint actin like colored people
If I cant work and make it, I steal and take it
They come up to me with a nigga who can put air in a bottle and sell it
He can do it man
A nigga can sell anything
As I watch the sky change colors
The rain flooded the neighborhoods of the black brothers
The black mothers are stressing, the coroners have covered
Another statistic, episodes of a cold summer
The street runners got the same legs of Michael Johnson
The fast life surpassed life beyond the conscience
Profanity in the air, the children use the content
The vanitys in the air, that Louis bag: haunted
The black girl with the hair, thats kind of coarse
Her baby daddys in court, she smoking on a Newport
Seventeen with dreams of becoming a stripper
Or becoming an AIDS victim while touching them zippers
The life that we living in, things we would do just to live again
How can an angel forever live in sin?
Dont you know
That its true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Dont you know
That its true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Dont you know
That its true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Dont you know
That its true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
You know, anybody that uses somebody else to gain is pimpin
Well, I tell you what soul brother, lookie here
Cant nobody pimp you but your pimp ass self
You understand?
Then theres a lot of funky things in this country
And theres a lot of good things too
But theres more funky than good
Shit aint gettin better
Weve changed some for the best
Awful lot of cases for the worst
And some, they have not changed at all
This is King Kendrick Lamar
Kendrick Lamar, the best rapper
Especially if you never heard music before 2010
I be the new DMC
When Im crying up on the beat
Im not the king of New York
Im lying straight through my teeth
I take a bit of the meat
And I put it between a bun
And I eat it its really fun
I go on a burger run
Im from Compton
But Im supposed to say Bompton
I know someone in my hood
Like Fxck Kendrick Ill stop em
Soon as I get around him
Im going round and round
I merry go til I vomit
I got ears like comic
So when Im in a cartoon
Dont laugh like Im retarded
I got ears like a fan
And they just wave like I farted
Tryna block out the smell
Of dead bodies and homis
When you take your last breath
You turn your drawers to a potty
I killed Jay on a song
They acted like it didnt happen
Soon as I did Control
Now they wanna start rapping
All these niggas is hype
But I aint impressing Phil Jackson
Got the Brian McKnight fade
Cause my hair started napping
Crips asked me my set
I turned around and I ran
Mama keep calling me
Cause she still need her van
I got sneakers like Vans
My Vans looking like sneakers
Broke the screen on my phone
Now I cant see when you tweet us
Im in love with Aaliyah
So me and Drake gon relate
When twin cousins named Fist and Hand
Go blam when they see ya
Dont talk to my old lady
I feel like Usher and Kellz
You can have Sherane
I know that her pussy smells
Compton
With so much knock in the LBC
It was hard not to claim that DPG
Summertime popped in the L-A-C
With the music courtesy of D-A-Z
And the Soopa, Doopa, Fly for the troopers
Riders, supers, hoes, groupies
All of em with the short tight jeans on
Lets Play House all of em theme song
Word on the gangsta, squad up
Black, brown, throw a St. Ides up
Then the West got harder
And Soopafly hit em on the head on Tha Doggfather
Dont nobody party like the West though
G-Funk been the sound since Death Row
Where you think we got the kicked-in clap at?
Time to bring it back, bitch, and its like that
Only in L.A. 
Where the gangstas play 
Catching up on fame
Summertime in, West Coast ride
Im about that shit, hoe, gotta get this money
Long Beach, C-R-Son, all the shit is sunny
Put the monkey in it, like the shit is funny
Banana Clip Rassy bout to spit this dummy
But funkers told me to kick back
I like revenge, retaliation, and get back, nigga
Got more bars than Kit-Kat
Get smacked like Katt Stacks if you lip jack
A muhfucker betta recognize
With a flick of my wrist like a Vulcan, you all die
All I do is ball high
Tryna stay above the rim like a tall guy
Dat Nigga Daz, Soopafly, alright
Lexus, , left lanes, all ride
OG to BG, I thought I warn ya
Only in California
Moving down Rosecrans, bumping D-A-Z
Feeling like 1-9-9-3, only one to the 710
Im in Long Beach, home of Dillinger
Dealing the gangsta shit, gangsta killa
You wankstas quit filling ya iPod up with classics
Aint a nigga out could match them ad-libs
D-P-G-C General
Gin on my breath while Jennifer hold my genitals
Yeah its like that cause I was taught that
Back when Dogg Food dropped in the Compton Swap Meet parking lot
Daddy V had three, sold one to my pops
We was popping out, the trunk in the Caddy was rocking out
Slap a nigga in the face with the 808s
Even made Pac salute, snares like a bear trap
Theyre unbearable too, bare witness
Hits like Barry Bonds, Daz the realest
Every good thing has got to come to an end
So rewind this shit back, take it to the top
Bring it back down, like your bitch is giving me head, ya
Its that classic crack shit
It aint over
Its that Watts city takeover
Top Dawg ENT

I’m good in the hood cause I motivated them niggas
I graduated from dumb hoes and mault liquor
To expensive wine and dime bitches
Red lining the DB9 like it’s my time pimping
Audemar quality time spending
And you niggas is borderline bitches
That’s my opinion
And my niggas is ride or die Aftermath my religion
Talk out but I don’t listen

Run you dick suckers, keep me out that bitch
Before I spazz and squirt and I’m out that...bitch
Broadcasting live from Compton California where foreigners never come Mothers are worrisome and we dislike the governor
I hope these angels can cover us

Coroners about to cover up everybody
I’m serious, every shotty is sawd off
And every nigga is militant
And your gut like...What?

All my life beed OG aw now my life on the billboard soon
Give me room, I react like a wildebeest and
Throw salt inside your wound your just diabetes to me
Aint shit sweet with these hotels homie
That crip shit got my uncle’s life in jail ho
So if I put the same line, theyll never forgive me
Or worse than that the niggas right around the corner might kill me
I’m fighting back when it’s hard what
No barber my guards up, the author of fallen fathers that did it without much, this my house nigga
Whose house is this? Money out the … can’t count that shit
Stacking death prez, mouth to mouth that shit
When they said a nigga wouldnt amount to shit
Now whose house is this? Laughing so hard my tongue is out and shit
Run you dick suckers, keep me out that bitch
Before I spazz and squirt and I’m out that...bitch

Kendrick Lamar might actually agree with SPINs Brandon Soderberg that his flame-stoking Control verse is not as impressive as it seems. After declaring himself King of New York, the Prince of Compton retreated to a land of gonzo Robin Thicke videos, Miley-fied MTV VMA performances, and unlimited BET awards nominations, while his peers lobbed response after response after response after response after, um, Hitler parody video.
But at long, last Lamar himself has issued a response, which more or less amounts to: Yall trippin. In an interview with Peter Rosenberg of New Yorks Hot 97, the Black Hippy was asked what he thought about all of the excitement surrounding his Big Sean cameo.  was just a feature verse, he humble-bragged before revealing that it took him a few days to notice the hubub, since hed been hanging out in the U.K. and all. Hed just wanted to rap some bars.
The 20-minute chat can be heard below — hit play on the YouTube rip below to hear Lamars thoughts on bicoastal rivalries, dangerous Twitter friends, and the business of elevating rap — but another gem emerged via a mere snippet of his forthcoming talk with Los Angeles radios Power 106. Regarding his self-coronation, the West Coast MC let out a kingly scoff, lamented that hes been misunderstood, and let slip that hes been conferring with other rap royals.
I think thats a case of, yeah, maybe I have to dumb down my lyrics just a little bit, said Lamar. The irony of that line is the people that actually understood it and got it was the actual kings of New York — we’ve been sitting down with them this past week — and them understanding that it’s not about actually being the king of whatever coast, it’s about leaving a mark as great as Biggie, as great as Pac.” The entire Power 106 conversation airs Friday morning.
Death
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now Im countin this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact Im downin this
DUSSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, wont you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin Tetris
AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
Its levels to it, you and I know
Bitch, be humble 
Sit down 
Be humble 
Sit down 
Be humble 
Bitch, sit down 
Be humble

Who that nigga thinkin that he frontin on Man-Man? 
Get the fuck off my stage, Im the Sandman 
Get the fuck off my dick, that aint right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
Im so fuckin sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mamas couch in Polo socks

Und dherrschaft wird erherter dfessle wärde feschter

Каждое утро, когда я встаю, я знаю зачем мне дальше идти
Много всего старается сбить, но мне не свернуть с нужного пути
Много лживых друзей, много шлюх хотят часть меня оторвать
И каждый раз их ожидает провал
Сила ведь в правде – и это факт
 СД & Ekzzz
И что бы ни случилось – похуй
Что бы ни случилось дальше
Что бы ни случилось, знаешь
Время идет, и мы стали старше
 2 Ekzzzz
Москва не верит слезам, но Jack Daniels скучные будни разбавит
В конце обернешься, посмотришь на труд свой – гордость за то, что сделали сами
Большая скорость, громкая музыка – это точно про нас, да
Ногинск это точка «А» в точку «Б» - Соколиная гора, брат
Планы – вперед, к вершине мира, и бить по тормозам не резон
Большая жизнь, большие цели и первый заработанный миллион
СД
Родной город даст мне силы – себя чувствую как босс
Много километров впереди ,проедем – не вопрос
В Питере родных и близких много, как и в Новосибе
Но Москва со мной всегда. Москва – тебе спасибо
СД & Ekzzz
И что бы ни случилось – похуй
Что бы ни случилось дальше
Что бы ни случилось, знаешь
Время идет, и мы стали старше
Что бы ни случилось, пережить помогут нам всегда верные друзья и Москва
Люблю тебя, Москва

Я слишком часто ошибался в людях, потом больно из-за этого очень
И нет гарантий, что это в последний раз – подъебут еще, хочешь не хочешь
Но то, что дальше будет, точно стоит прогулки босиком по раскаленным углям
Зови меня Кларк Кент, я чуть выше этого. Быть Суперменом чертовски трудно
Я найду свою Лоис Лейн в толпе из Вавилонских блудниц
Моя жизнь – только подъем к вершине, и больше никто меня не тянет вниз
Были моменты когда уставал, опускал руки, но отдыхать больше нельзя
Сейчас я многим лучше, чем был. Осознать это мне помогли друзья
Для сотен MC, как кость в горле. На фоне меня они девочки, тупо
Я знаю, что каждый из них, даже тот, что респекты кидает, хочет, чтоб я был трупом
Но sorry, зай, до жопы дел. Пусть эти девочки плачут дальше
Москва поддержит, но если хочешь замеса со мной – оставь надежду
Уже не будет как прежде, каждый, кто будет против – будет повержен
Раньше я будто во сне жил, однажды проснулся - нашел в себе титановый стержень
Passo per Passo , verso del sogno – и только так, без вопросов
Как бы ни было сложно - nessun rimpianto, nessun rimorso

She is after the reception of cocaine she will be sent back to the cells, 
Bitches Love Salsa, Niggas Love Coca
Bitches Love Salsa, Niggas Love Coca
Bitches Love Salsa, Niggas Love Coca
Bitches Love Salsa, Niggas Love Coca
All my niggas love Cocaine I have shit and hot fame
Don’t wrap it up in gold
Don’t hide it behind the sun
Just give it to me as it is
And let it stand
Don’t fly it like a kite
Between the clouds
It needs no excuse
Just bring it down
Let eyes that are in pain look upon it
In all its glory
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
For every voice that is lifted
In reverence and pain
Show us now
And let love not be chained
We should feel what we can stand
And let us be alive
So we know
That we’ve done all we can
Let hearts that are frozen get to see it
In all its glory
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
And let all that is lost be forgotten
And it will pass
So let all that is lost be forgotten
Let us move on
Like the waters in the open sea
When tribulations come all we can say is hopefully
And yesterday you could probably say theres no hope for me
But today Im overly dedicated, Im posed to be
A testimony for broken hearts in the city
You either crash landing or planning on flying with me
Misery loves standing behind its company, well
Vividly I can see that your feelings would like to dwell
On our past encounters, reaching over the counter
Told me that its a appealing to pop a pill, thats a downer
I heard emotions burn deep
I heard when you fall out of love the drop is steep
I heard when you see a dove, thats what you try be
Got these burdens under my wings, but Im still free
Cause I can make the decision to let it all go away
Before I ever run astray Ill look you in the eye and say
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass

Beast mode, motherfuckers bout to get hit

Figured it was about time for people to eat crow
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?

I dont wanna fuckin listen to you spit your raps someone else wrote
Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldnt do shit but just sit still
Now moneys not a big deal
Im rich, I wipe my ass with six mill
Big bills like a platypus
A caterpillars comin to get the cannabis
Im lookin for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin
Batterin everything and Ive had it with the inadequate
Man, I can see my dick is standin stiff as a mannequin
And Im bringin the bandana back, and the fuckin headband again
A handkerchief and Im thinkin of bringin the fuckin fingerless gloves back
And not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap
I sound like a fuckin millionaire
With a Derringer with a hair trigger
Bout to bear hug a fuckin terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Yall couldnt hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin air duct
Im bout to bare-knuckle it, nah, fuck it
Im gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket
Abraca-fuckin-dabra
The track is the blood, Im attracted, Im attackin it

As a kid, having a mentor was vital to me. Always being there when it counted allowed me to make some of the most important decisions while growing up. So its only right that I mentor a younger person with the same wisdom that was given to me. If it helps the next kid become a better person in life, I will forever be aware of my influence and pay it forward. I look where Im at today and realize that most of my success is owed to the mentors that was in my life.
I sat down with President Barack Obama and shared the same views. Topics concerning the inner cities, the problem, the solutions and furthermore embracing the youth, both being aware that mentoring saves lives. Sometimes I reflect and think back, Where would I be if I didnt had the presence of an older acquaintance telling me whats right and what’s wrong? Telling me the pros and cons of every move I was about to make. Telling me the best way to plan success for my future. Join me in paying it forward. Support My Brothers Keeper by being a mentor in real life.
Mirror see, mirror tell
My whole life I was lucid dreaming awake
Thats why all these years I couldnt find my way
Couldnt see my fate, couldnt picture my name
On a history book, after the word great
It was silly cause thats all i ever wished for
Lost in a world which I could not get before
Found myself on a full moon night
He was a werewolf, he tried to hide
Seems like he was a little bit shy
I knew it wasnt easy, but hoped and tried
To find him, to see how things go
But I was too scared to show
Forced him to unveil, although he didnt want
I put in risk our agglomerated bond
He went mad, then I lost my temper
But we were twins, new 9/11
We werent angry, weve never been
But we were searching, and searchings a sin
And I felt like I was stupid as hell
We are the same, what did I expect?
I was an airhead and ignorant, thats all
Didnt know how to calm, this aflutter soul
Now its me versus me, we should be amassed
But when the affray starts, there is no trust
We were afoul, why not try afresh
Amalgamations afoot, no more this mess
Hoped it would work under these circumstances
Cause deep down there was fire, under these ashes
Just couldnt be found, I coulndt realise
That I am the truth behind peoples lies
In the aftereffect of being a stranger to me
In the aftermath of being a beast set free
Maybe Im a hero, cause I fought my monster
Commited hubris, but I showed my luster
Maybe no hero, but who could stand this
Not knowing who are you
Not knowing whose is
The reflection in the mirror
These eyes seem known
But the whole picture makes my mind blown
Thats why Im searching to find myself
The mirror wont talk, trapped in its hell
Thats why Im searching to find who I am
The mirror cant see, what I really became
Thats why Im searching to find whos the man
Inside that mirror, behind that verse
I watched my life happening but I dont know if Im existing
I admitted Im great but I dont know if I mean it
I tried to know more , what the hell was I thinking
How can I know more when I dont know if Im living
My existence an illusion, my personality a creation
Everything around me a conscious hallucination
Lucid dreaming, or dreaming reality
Going crazy , all the way to insanity
Going schizo like the great John Nash
Hope these voices stop fore I prove Riemmans
Losing worth, degrading myself
Suicide bomber, havent snapped yet
We Kamikazes convinced, for what we believe in
So are you, cause you think, realitys what you live in
Not something you made, not something you hope for
You hope these words aint real, but they are. I think so
I made em for me, or you made em for you
You made me to peep subconscious truth
You actually made me be part of that
Part of a world you actually made up
Aint no truth is true, so hows reality real
Aint no me is you, but we share the same idea
Aint gonna stop, but Ill make a pause
Cause Im exhausted by these solipsist thoughts
Murder wack rappers peacefully,listen breathe easily/
Seems to me you hate seeing me spit but bitch leave me be/
These sick ass bars make you nauseous watch your back keep cautious/
Im the little engine that could i know i cant stop this/
Im the fucking feces i tear mcs into pieces/
I eat all you dumb asses for breakfast like wheaties/
Some days i dont have enough middle fingers to go round/
Fuck the doubt the time is now to make all my haters proud/
Wanna hook ill give you a hook going straight through your jaws/
Strictly lyrical something spiritual nothing but bars/
Fuck opponents look at music components their composing/
You know wits owning, everyone else fake they just posing/
Im one earth to enlighten to spark the brain like lightning/
To brighten up your world so much to leave haters sightless/
They put you down like yey low down on the ground like jay lo/
But you gotta rise up from all the hate and say hell no/
Sometimes your exhausted dont have inspiration lost it/
Haters mouths keep running like faucets blabbering nonsense/
Weve all been fucking suppressed oppressed too stressed to get rest/
Thats exactly why their obsessed to get you upset/
Our main goal as humans is be shaded by money trees/
Money heats money feeds,let me tell you what money means/
Of course we need it but most of us spend for wrong reasons/
Not feeding needy who be pleading the streets weakly/
Instead we buy the ps3s psps 360s while people out their struggling to eat/
Yo, in order to change the world we need to change ourselves/
Have you seen the news lately fucking world going to hell/
Let us come together fuck dividing stop the lying/
Were going straight to extinction the future is coming start the thinking/
Plan ahead before were all dead/
Two shot the diligence
I slide on my hater like skrrt 
I’m killing this shit don’t get murked 
Two shot the diligence
No more reminiscing on who shot, we finish it
Blade runner, walking on thin ice, admit it is
Hot feet running, I been nice, I’m it, legit

I want you
To live in my bed
Why dont you
Just live in my bed
Then I can wake up
To your face
Whenever I open up my eyes
So why dont you just live in my bed
Pack your bags
Come get away baby dont look back
I got a pillow with your name on it
Dont hesitate to put your head on it
Just stay the weekend
My bed will make you want to move in
If you wanna we can sleep in
Baby heres a proposition
Listen
I want you
To live in my bed
Why dont you
Just live in my bed
Then I can wake up
To your face
Whenever I open up my eyes
So why dont you just live in my bed
Baby come here
Hit the freeway then I switch gears
Drive pass to it, let my love pass through it
Wed be living in the mist of the wonder years
We can hear the drop of tears
Every time we drop the top
Do it anywhere, do it here, do it there
Leave the mall and do it in a parking lot
Ooo, you look so sexy
Not to many impress me
Then she reply
My God, boy, shut the fuck up and just undress me
Damn youre gorgeous
Runnin circles in my head
Now baby girl, pack your bags and catch a cab
I want you
To live in my bed
Why dont you
Just live in my bed
Then I can wake up
To your face
Whenever I open up my eyes
So why dont you just live in my bed
My love for music, my passion for it, you know thats my life, you know? Its not just a job for me, its truly a lifestyle. I wake up, I think about or a verse, I go to sleep Im thinking about it. I walk out, throughout my day, you know I think about music.
During the Revolt interview, Lamar was also talked about the important role that music plays in his life today.
Its just something I breathe now, I didnt always breathe it. I always was a fan of it, but now I really live it. Thats inspiration within itself.
Well be going into the middle of December, which is a blessing, a lot of people dont get the opportunity to be on a major stage in front of that many people and be able to learn. Im just taking it all in stride and being a student of the game because Kanye , hes a great performer. Im not too shabby, like I said, again, but Im just there really to challenge myself, grow myself and take that next level.
During the brief interview, Lamar was also asked about what his next steps are.
Really getting back in that studio, locking in. Just keep continue with music, continue challenging myself. I dont really got much goin on outside of music. So, thats about it.
I spend most of my days with fleeting thoughts. Writing. Listening. And collecting old Beach cruisers. The morning rides keep me on a hill of silence.
I go months without a phone.
Love, loss, and grief have disturbed my comfort zone, but the glimmers of God speak through my music and family.
While the world around me evolves, I reflect on what matters the most. The life in which my words will land next.
As I produce my final TDE album, I feel joy to have been a part of such a cultural imprint after 17 years. The Struggles. The Success. And most importantly, the Brotherhood. May the Most High continuе to use Top Dawg as a vessel for candid crеators. As I continue to pursue my lifes calling.
Theres beauty in completion. And always faith in the unknown.
Thank you for keeping me in your thoughts. Ive prayed for you all.
See you soon enough.

Persuasive invasion, that could cost our life
Head in the clouds but my vision alright
Looking though fog, yeah my head at the night

Just like Im Kanye, they think I’m insane
Look up to God and he calling my name
How can I handle the faith and the fame
Tryna rain, tryna rain on the thunder
Tell the storm Im new

Painting white flags blue

Running blind in truth

Hear me out
Cada negro es una estrella, ey, cada negro es una estrella
Cada negro es una estrella, ey, cada negro es una estrella
Cada negro es una estrella, ey
¿Quién va a negar que tú y yo y cada negro es una estrella?
Hit me!
Cuando las cuatro esquinas de este capullo colisionen
Te resbalarás a través de las grietas esperando sobrevivir
Acumula tu ingenio, mira profundamente hacia adentro
¿Realmente eres quien idolizan?
Enchular una mariposa
Al principio, sí te amaba
Pero ahora solo quiero follar
Noches tardías pensando en ti
Hasta conseguir venirme
Arrojado y volteado, lección aprendida
Fuiste mi primera novia
Puentes quemados, a través del tablero
Destruido, ¿pero para qué?
Cuando me contraten, amigo, me haré el tonto
Darle a la pista de baile, luces estroboscópicas en la sala
Robarme a tu pequeña perra secretaria para los amigos
Diablo de ojos azules con un mono de culo gordo
Me compraré un Caddy nuevo con bogas
Representaré al barrio, dos veces, .24
Platino en todo, platino en un anillo de bodas
Casado con el juego y con una perra mala elegida
Cuando me contraten, amigo, compraré un arma
Directo de la CIA, manteniéndola en mi regazo
Llevaré algunos M-16 al barrio
Pasarlos todos en la cuadra, ¿Qué tal?
Pondré el Swap Meet de Compton junto a la Casa Blanca
Candidato republicano, seré golpeado
Hablar con el presidente con una cubana en el cuello
No educado, pero conseguí un cheque de un millón de dólares así
No debimos dar
No debimos dar a los negros dinero
Vuelve a casa, dinero, vuelve a casa
No debimos dar
No debimos dar a los negros dinero
Vuelve a casa, dinero, vuelve a casa
Al principio, sí te amaba 
Pero ahora solo quiero follar 
Noches tardías pensando en ti 
Hasta conseguir venirme 
Arrojado y volteado, lección aprendida
Fuiste mi primera novia
Puentes quemados, a través del tablero 
Destruido, ¿pero para qué?
Ey, ¿qué tal? Es Dre
¿Recuerdas la primera vez que viniste a la casa?
Dijiste que querías un lugar como el mío
Pero recuerda, todos pueden obtenerlo
Lo difícil es mantenerlo, hijo de puta
¿Qué quieres? ¿Una casa o un auto?
¿Cuarenta acres y una mula, un piano, una guitarra?
Cualquier cosa, mira, mi nombre es el tío Sam, soy tu amigo
Hijo de puta, puedes vivir en el mall
Conozco a los tuyos 
No tengo pruebas 
Págame luego, ponte esos lagartos
¿Cliché? Luego di, A la mierda tus haters
Puedo ver el derroche en ti, puedo ver el dólar en ti
Pequeñas mentiras blancas, pero no hay collar blanco en ti
Pero no importa porque aún te sigo
Porque me haces vivir por siempre, bebé
Cuéntalo todo junto, bebé
Luego ve al cajero y hazme sentir mejor, bebé
Tu horóscopo es géminis, dos lados
Así que mejor compra todo dos veces
Dos coupés, dos cadenas, dos de $100
Demasiado no es suficiente, ambos sabemos
Navidad, diles qué hay en tu lista de deseos
Consiguelo todo, lo mereces, Kendrick
Y cuando llegues a la Casa Blanca, haz lo tuyo
Pero recuerda, no pasaste economía en la escuela
Y todo lo que compres, los impuestos lo negarán
Te haré un Wesley Snipe antes de los treinta y cinco
Sí, mirando abajo, es una gran caída 
Viéndote bien estando en la cima 
Tienes una medalla para nosotros
Dejando metáforas metafisicamente en un estado de euforia
Mira dos veces antes de cruzar por mi mente
No debimos dar
No debimos dar a los negros dinero
Vuelve a casa, dinero, vuelve a casa
No debimos dar
No debimos dar a los negros dinero
Vuelve a casa, dinero, vuelve a casa
Viene el recaudador, viene el recaudador
Viene el recaudador, viene el recaudador
Viene el recaudador, viene el recaudador
Viene el recaudador, viene el recaudador
At the end of it all
No one wants to drink alone
Baby, thats how it goes
Don’t walk away from me
Fragmented memories
Sentences incomplete
Thats when she said
Dont wanna put up a fight anymore
I’m down to the end of my rope
And Im freefalling
Ill search inside myself
I need to know why I act this way
A whisper turns to a scream
I cant ignore it no more
At the end of it all
No one wants to drink alone
Baby, thats how it goes
From my eyewitness binoculars 
To Argentina and Africa 
We mastered the pressure 
Hazardous , harassing us 
You laugh at us 
More accurate at bagging dimes, now we bagging rhymes
Bodybags, price tags on your forehead
Nine times out of ten, young niggas are nine or ten
When the line becomes thin: be a killer or fireman
Fill up the lavish pen if I needed to right my wrongs
I cant deny sin, condolences through these palms
I remember when your cousin was coming home
My bitch, why we plotted to kill him cause we ain’t know him
Unfamiliar faces make niggas nervous
Convicted court cases might hit the surface
Restricted territories might come through lurkin’
We aint want none of that urgent call
Well, I’ma act Turk and fall on my identity, percocets
For all the headaches, Im bout to bring confetti
Tumble out this barrel soon as it ring, you ready?
That was the word for we moved on ’em
Treat him like Joe the Plumber
I wonder if someone come and can see this tool on him
Immature and retarded is what you call me
Your cousin want coming home from the pen but from the army
If I can right my wrongs and pen this verse I read
Even though a bullet hit him in the leg, still walk on by
At the end of it all
No one wants to drink alone
Baby thats how it goes
Dont walk away from me
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Designer head to toe 
I sip to the head and float 
I already bagged the pole 
You niggas too scared to go 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I clean up like hands and soap 
Get a mink, let it drag on the floor 
Its a nine in the bag that I tote 
Workin’ hard, we aint havin no hope 
Put the pussy on a pedestal 
Put the pussy on a high horse
That pussy to die for
That pussy to die for
Peter Piper picked a pepper
So I could pick your brain and put your heart together
We depart the shady parts and party hard

Its all about this money, kid
Its all about this money, C.R.E.A.M
Ynamean?
I gotta get it, son
I gotta get it, my pockets hurt again
(Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money)
Starvin out here, yo
I grew up on the crime side
The LA Times-side
Wrong turn might mean homicide
Used to move with the Rupers
Talk shit, well shoot ya
At your dice game, rob ya for your moolah
Its like that
Cash rules everything
Fiends strung out
So they try to sell you anything
Listen son
Never sell crack for fun
I was hungry
A nigga sold crack for funds
Had to get my weight up
Enemies, sprayed up
Got rid of the whole brick, and then we re-up
Sittin in a money spot
Cookin up the product
You tried to infiltrate the shop
You got shot up
Lil kids in the projects
They wanna be us
No father figures
Nothin that you could teach us
Ghetto streets-raised
Is blowin weed and Black & Milds
Gangbangin
Cane-slangin for deaths and miles
Livin wild
Young, black, and dont give a fuck
Just a young hustler
Specializing in getting bucks
Nigga, some garden is where we get our hustle at
Aint shit to say even one time
We bussin that
Theres no discrimination
You will get assassinated for the paper
Shoot first and ask questions later
See ya later, alligator
As your casket drop
Then we back to the block
And we steady sayin
Yo, straight up son
Thats what its about
Its all about this cream, yall
Cash rules everything around me
Ynamean?
Snotty-nosed kid with dreams of getting C.R.E.A.M
Like cake batter
By any means, son
We make your face splatter
Word life
I never understood the broke type
Thinkin back then when I hustled my first stolen bike
I used to gamble with silver dollars
Now I gamble with Benjamin Franklins, Dom Pérignon, and lobster
Money-making for real, kid
Im tryin stay fresh like Will did
Back in the 90s
Killer bees behind me
Swarming anything that enter the perimeter
Of this money-making machine
When winter come
It goes down
We balls out
And you?
You just out of bounds
Without a doubt
We move in unison
You move like a Honda with the brakes gone out
Out of control
You just might
Powder your nose
If you step on the mic after me
Drug residue
Every time I leave the booth
You fall far behind
A time machine cant save you
Me?
Im ahead of the pack
Like a high-speed pursuit
We kick flows
Then rekick em like kung fu
Im Bruce Lee
Whether Nikes or Timbos
Beefcake the poppy, see
We aint scared to shoot
Carry three pieces on me
Like a Steve Harvey suit
Im on my Method Man shit
The 3 west coast Wu Tang members now exist
For the C.R.E.A.M. I beam to retrieve it
Believe it
I aint only sowin, I reapin
Benefits up the asshole
Is that so?
Damn straight
Fabricated transaction by a handshake
I win by a landslide
Scopin your landscape
Kick in the damn door
Give me your damn safe
They all say crime dont pay
But if itll get me more than what this 9-to-5 gon pay
Rock, let me borrow the K
Hit my adversaries
Id rather it be a bullet than my vocabulary
Currently stash currency in the shoebox
For emergency purposes only
So Im never worthless
Bubblin like a bottom of my way
Way, stacks so fat
Benjamins growin a double chin
Raised the quota for quotas
Hunnid dollar knot holders
Livin that dream
Gettin that C.R.E.A.M
It take 36 Chambers
Thats 18 double-barrel shotties aimed at everybody in the way
No gettin between this
Just a genius
Inspect your deck
No money involved?
Expect eject
Yo, its only for Cuban links
And your necklace is anorexic
Get your weight up
Im runnin to the bank like Im off a bounce pass
Then I layup
I live every day up
Top notch
In other words
Stay up
Love, lets talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? 
I know the feeling haunt you 
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Tell me what you gon do to me
Confrontation aint nothin new to me
You can bring a story, bring your words, bring em all
But you cant bring thе truth to me
Not you and all your expectations
I dont еven want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
Tell my momma, thats the realest thing
Love, lets talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? 
I know the feeling haunt you 
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Its covered in ego
Get to talkin like ya involved, like a rebound
Got no end game, got no reason, got to stay down
Its the way that you making me feel cause it feels good
I wouldnt do it at all if it feel bad
Better live your life, were runnin out of time
Love, lets talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? 
I know the feeling haunt you 
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Kendrick Lamar might actually agree with SPINs Brandon Soderberg that his flame-stoking Control verse is not as impressive as it seems. After declaring himself King of New York, the Prince of Compton retreated to a land of gonzo Robin Thicke videos, Miley-fied MTV VMA performances, and unlimited BET awards nominations, while his peers lobbed response after response after response after response after, um, Hitler parody video.
But at long, last Lamar himself has issued a response, which more or less amounts to: Yall trippin. In an interview with Peter Rosenberg of New Yorks Hot 97, the Black Hippy was asked what he thought about all of the excitement surrounding his Big Sean cameo.  was just a feature verse, he humble-bragged before revealing that it took him a few days to notice the hubub, since hed been hanging out in the U.K. and all. Hed just wanted to rap some bars.
The 20-minute chat can be heard below — hit play on the YouTube rip below to hear Lamars thoughts on bicoastal rivalries, dangerous Twitter friends, and the business of elevating rap — but another gem emerged via a mere snippet of his forthcoming talk with Los Angeles radios Power 106. Regarding his self-coronation, the West Coast MC let out a kingly scoff, lamented that hes been misunderstood, and let slip that hes been conferring with other rap royals.
I think thats a case of, yeah, maybe I have to dumb down my lyrics just a little bit, said Lamar. The irony of that line is the people that actually understood it and got it was the actual kings of New York — we’ve been sitting down with them this past week — and them understanding that it’s not about actually being the king of whatever coast, it’s about leaving a mark as great as Biggie, as great as Pac.” The entire Power 106 conversation airs Friday morning.

Thinking bout living without
Past, present Dr. Dre 
I tripped off 600 seconds
10 minutes exact

Like what if Pac never to get them shots through the door?
They say Suge did it, but he was in imerginsy clinic

But in the process get dont make sence
Its like the code, tryna solve the crime of these rap souls
What if Big never did it big?
Never went to LA, 
Wouldve made my flow more 
 was fucking with Hov
 if it wasnt personal, if Jay wasnt intemet
Probably be less people listening
Thinking its a poblisity stunt, what if he partnered with Jay? Still didnt pull over
Nothing different, quite similar
 my copasity, thinking about Martin Luther on the balkany
What if the shooter What if Malcolm on his side?
Kill 2 birds with 1 stone, both wouldve died
Now lets rewind
Imagine
Can you imagine?
 in the sky
Can you imagine?
Imagine if Tooky was a Blood?
No disrespect, thered b more Bloods than Crips 
Dominating the population of LA
Orange County, the vally 
Imagine if we didnt really start this gangsta shit
Yall wouldnt have nothing to spit
No drive byes, no flags hanging out pockets
 just rapping like Crush Crew
 perseption walking 
 be alive
Or would he have been lost his life to the streets?
Not to mention, no cars in that driveway
What if Freeway Rick never was a kingpin?
On this LA strip with these rap niggas 
What if rap niggas never had rap?
 ass backwards
Now these rappers getting caught with the cocaine, to smoke, not to slang
Imagine that, people not knowing that these rap niggas is insane
Just think about it
Imagine
Can you imagine?
 in the sky
Can you imagine?
Imagine life without death
Would you even feel alive?
 what if they never died?
Imagine seeing your mom cry tears of happiness
Knowing her son safe and she aint lose him to this maddness
A street living with a crack epodemic
Never reached the projects, they destroyed our buildings
Turned most of us to killers, inesent victoms
Imagine if didnt effect our systom
They say drug money funded labels today
What about the drug money thats funding the CIA?
Imagine if they would try to fix these streets
Would they start in the hood? Or executive sweets?
Where the real criminals meet, and principle beef
 you could possibly live without heat
Imagine if Al Gore had won that election
The twin tower buildings still standing 
Imagine without wittness protection
Would it be this many cowards on the stand telling?
I dont know, Im just speaking my mind
Lost in my own soul, lets press rewind
Imagine
wont change
 give up that life
Someone always gets 
 in the hood
In the hood, in the hood
 for gangsters
Everyones banging, wannabe bangers
 by these rap singers
 that raised us
 consequence of gun battles
And police chases
They dont want the hood life, they want hood relations
 radio stations
I been there, done that, lost a lotta homies over this shit
See my relitives buy crack
 pack
Give to me 
So my moms can eat
Dawg I see struggle where I live, its 
But I cant stop, wont stop, 
Getting payed off my pain
Thats the drop
 wont change
 give up that life
Someone always gets 
 in the hood
In the hood, in the hood
Drug dealers on the block, feends looking for hard rock
Niggas on the rooftop, choppers aint afraid of coppers
They come through, they seeing them doctors
Put them in I.C.U
Get them hood rats poison ivy too
From hustlers that wanna harvest it
Dice games played on the side of the building
 children
Now adays anybody can play the victom
Straight bullits 
In the city 
Niggas go on project living
And thats why I cant stop, wont stop
Till yall do stop getting payed off my pain
Just the backdrop
 wont change
 give up that life
Someone always gets 
 in the hood
In the hood, in the hood
 hold hands 
Give them a mouthfull like the neighborhood dental
 everything they pretend to
Be, the streets, lay down on the ground
And sleep
This my home like first base
Balling on the curb like a pitcher
The erge of a 187 
 like the 
 white T
 dump the gun and just start running
The ghetto chef onion
 tear you apart
Cant stop, wont stop
Till everybody stop
Payed off our pain
Thats the backdrop
 wont change
 give up that life
Someone always gets 
 in the hood
In the hood, in the hood
Niggas mad that I can rap
Just imagine if I stayed in the trap
Cooking up chickens like Colonel Sanders up in the kitchen
I spit it like Im reminiscin
Make it a premonition
Listen
I was just a lad on my project steps
Now that Im thinking back, the projects was the best
But niggas mad that I can rap
They even turn they heads when they giving me dap
Because they bitches heads always fall in my lap
I just jump and I swim, and I run me a lap
I wish Q-Tip wouldve given me this track
I wouldve boddied it, like the aftermath or shotty kicks
Supеrb, with my nouns and verbs
I can splurge a rhyme, or takе a rappers critical lifeline
On my life Im not lying
They bite mine, Im a pipe bomb, squeezin the game
Big guns like SOCOM, I got aim
Troopas bazookas could shoot down planes
But thats another note
Let me bless you with another quote
I remain unseen, grab you a telescope
Im hella dope like like 36 os of coke
Round table, mixin Hennesy with the coke
This gonna be a cold winter, better buy a coat
Top Dog money gang, nigga we a cult
I aint got a bank account, dawg I got a vault
And you got my name in your mouth by the gulp
I withstand all that, give me my check and respect, I demand all that
Before I blam all that
And my gun dont jam like that, bombaclot
Get your mama shot, me fear none
Where the rum, Jay Rock?
Go head and flex
I be at them niggas necks like a racist cop
Just better hope they stay afloat like a boat at the dock
Somebody call me a doc, Im bout to lose it
Ironically Im smart as , but my flow stupid
So stupid that I closed my eyes, wrote a rhyme
By my fourteenth bar, envisioned The Three Stooges
Expression of the shit I write is like who pooed it?
I shit on a rapper, then make they wifey call me Brutus
However we can do this
Flow sharper than a machete
And I can stab you in the back like Im Judas
You rap like your raps is the hottest or the coolest
I rap like Im wrapped in the hands of a god
Throw a fire bar then I scream out HADUKEN
Im Ryu when I ride through, how you
Pyrus and the Crips say how you?
Because I turn a session into a typhoon
And boogie boys couldnt last one second, two
But niggas mad that I can rap
My arsenal make you look all bad for a rack
And you can admire me in the lab for a rack
I need a variety, bitches of cosmetology that could jump on the head
But you can keep all the rats, just model bitches with ass
That sit on top of they backs
Im on top and Im back
For the first time like a newborn spinal cord
Thats a line, press record
Whats goin on?
Why do you refuse to
Feel me, feel me, feel me
Lord, I need you to
Feel me, feel me, feel me
Tunchi
Niggas hatin, bitches hatin
Niggas hatin, bitches hatin

Now a days, they wonder

Matter fact, your flag hanging out the wrong way
You aint never no tags
You wouldnt know about nickle and dime bags of chronic

You can stop tryna clone us west coast niggas
And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recording this, wont you look in the sky?
Tell him that you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stabilitys never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley and peaks, with bare feet
Run through the flames, thats more passion for me
I passed testimony just so the world can see
My battle wounds on me, you watching me lick ‘em clean
I know, I know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows
I know, I know, its mind control
I know I could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by ya, what?
I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote
And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
Im trying to find my way back, theres no day off for heroes
And even when Im tired, go is the only word I know
And the night is takin over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin focus
Aint no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
Ill simply say its on again, its on again, whoa-oh
The world dont stop, its on again, its on again, whoa-oh
I am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness, I sacrifice my ego
There aint no room for selfish, we do it for the people
And the night is takin over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
[When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin focus
Aint no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward]
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
Ill simply say its on again, its on again, whoa-oh
The world dont stop, its on again, its on again, whoa-oh
Say the work dont stop, cause they dont stop
And everybody here tryna get on top
Everybody from the burbs down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and dont let go, let go
Huh, so you think you hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
You can have, or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto, ghetto
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
Ill simply say its on again, its on again, whoa-oh
The world dont stop, its on again, its on again, whoa-oh

Give me fuel for the fire burnin when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
Im a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, Ima wreck it, even if my record dont pop
Ima tie a knot on a downtown buildin
Let it tow behind me, tell em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is mе

Soldier, like a lieutenant
And the coupe tinted, got pulled over
Johnny always lock a nigga down, knowin damn well
We dont wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size
Ride like Pac in his prime; Thug Life is now on radar
Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscin when the L.A. Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncles dome
And I dont condone dickridin
Im addicted to Westsidin
Livin in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turned me to a lion
Tryin
Straight up out of Y City
Where niggas hustling, automatic murder for 
 sips of Henny, I had them niggas with the cemmies
Tryna murder the competition
Get money, thats the 
Slick talk out of your mouth, thatll leave your partner missing
Project kitchin, where the workers whippin
If you dont make dollars, you dont make sence
If you dont cook you wont make shit
Niggas on that bullshit, they dont wanna make money
I knock the soul out your flesh if you take from me
Im a hustler homie 
Got a mini 14 with a muffler on it

Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of em in my Chevy, tell em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, my karma coming heavy

Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, Im your dog, woof
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall

Digging in my pocket, no profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... Ah, !

Oh Señor, acudo ante ti como un pecador
Y me arrepiento humildemente de mis pecados
Creo que Jesús es el Señor
Creo que Tú le devolviste de la muerte
Pido que Jesús venga a mi vida
Y sea mi Señor y Salvador
Acepto que Jesús tome control de mi vida
Y que yo viva para él a partir de hoy
Gracias, Señor Jesús, por salvarme con tu preciada sangre
En el nombre de Jesús, amen
La conocí en esta fiesta en El Segundo and Central
Tenía las aptitudes de las strippers de Atlanta
Su culo era como una joroba, desde el principio ella era un camello
Quiero montarla como los Árabes, en un Mercedes-Benz del 2004
“Hola, me llamo Kendrick”, ella dijo: “No, eres guapo”
Me susurró al oído, desapareció, entonces la encontré bailando
Sonaba Ciara de fondo
La música de festival que había nos hacía llevar gafas de sol, cool
“Dónde vives?” Dijo ella, “Al final de la calle del Instituto Dominguez”
Ok, sé que ese es el límite entre Compton y Paramount
“Bien, eso es Compton?” “No”, ella contestó
Entonces comencé a flirtear con ella
Yo quería sus muslos alrededor de mí
Diecisiete y solamente podía pensar en coños
Mi motivación era bastante inmoral: “Qué estás intentando hacer?”
Ella no contestó, simplemente me dio su Nextel
Dejó caer su número, hablamos durante todo el verano, bien
El verano pasó, y ahora me está gustando
Las conversaciones que tuvimos probablemente le sedujeron
Quien lo hubiera imaginado? Quizás mis acciones harán que termine casándome con ella
Amor o lujuria, no importa, porque la vida mala está en nuestro ADN
Es profundo, la música de ser jóvenes y bobos
Nunca está silenciada, de hecho, está a mucho más volumen en el lugar de donde soy
Sabemos mucho el uno sobre el otro, su madre era una adicta al crack
Ella vive con su abuela y sus dos hermanos más jóvenes
Su primo favorito, Demetrius, es irrepetible
Su historial familiar pandillero me hacía sentir escéptico
Aunque no lo suficiente como para que deje de estar cachondo
“Quiero correrme, qué tal?”
Es lo que le dije tan pronto como el el episodio
De Martin termina, estoy intentando calentarme
Estaba tan caliente como un cactus
Mis tácticas de estar sediento puede que me hieran
Pero a la mierda, tenía corazón
Cogí las llaves de mi madre, me subí al coche, entonces, oh chico
Así que ahora voy por Rosecrans en un monovolumen
Atravesando Alameda, el depósito necesita ser rellenado
Tengo lo suficiente para pasar el atasco
Al menos eso espero, porque mis bolsillos están rotos como una promesa
Estoy pensando en follar
Pensando en sus muslos o quizás besando su cuello o quizás cuál será la siguiente posición
Ella me envía una foto de sus tetas, volviendo locos mis pensamientos
La miro, y casi me choco contra un Corvette
Entusiasmado por el roce con una mujer, ella es una masajista
Y yo soy una estrella del porno profesional intoxicado
Tengo uno de cincuenta en el maletero como Curtis Jackson para un rescate
Espero que ella esté suelta como un himno de Uncle Luke
Estoy a dos bloques de distancia, doscientos cincuenta pies
Y a seis pasos de donde ella está, me está saludando al otro lado de la calle
Me detengo, una sonrisa en mi cara, y entonces lo veo
Dos negros, dos sudaderas negras, me congelo y mi móvil comienza a sonar
Por favor, deja tu mensaje para el tres-dos-tres
Graba tu mensaje después del pitido
Kendrick, dónde estás?
Mierda, estoy aquí sentado esperando mi van
Me dijiste que ibas a estar de vuelta en quince minutos
Tengo que ir al ayuntamiento, los niños están listos para comer
Yo estoy lista para comer, mierda
Tengo que conseguir las cartillas de comida, vamos
Estás de camino o qué?
Espero que no estés por ahí con esos malditos chicos callejeros, mierda
Especialmente esa pequeña perra Sherane
A parte, que tú mañana tienes escuela
Si sigues estando todo el día por la calle, no pasarás al siguiente curso
Al undécimo curso
Tu padre dice algo sobre esos malditos dominós 
Quieres echarte la bronca también, vamos Kenny, venga
Hola? Mierda, dónde están mis jodidas fichas de dominó?
, Qué?
Estoy en este mensaje de voz, mierda , mierda
Dónde están mis jodidos dominos?
Es la segunda vez que te pido que traigas mis jodidas fichas de dominó
Pásame el jodido teléfono, mierda, no cuelgues, déjame
Kendrick, cuando recibas este mensaje, chico, llámame 
Necesito saber cuándo vas a traer el maldito coche
Este hombre quejándose sobre las malditas fichas de dominó
No es tan serio, mierda, los jodidos dominós
Mierda, no voy a llegar a mi maldita cita, joder
Que le jodan a los malditos dominós, nadie quiere oír eso
Nadie quiere oír tu culo
De hecho, vuelve a poner mis temas oldies
Estas destrozando mi jodida vibra
Soy un pecador, que probablemente va a pecar de nuevo
Señor, perdóname
Señor, perdóname
Hay cosas que no comprendo
A veces necesito estar solo
Perra, no jodas mi vibra
Perra, no jodas mi vibra
Puedo sentir tu energía desde dos planetas de distancia
Tengo mi bebida, tengo mi música
La compartiría, pero hoy estoy gritando
Perra, no destroces mi vibra
Perra, no destroces mi vibra
Perra, no destroces mi vibra
Perra, no destroces mi vibra
Mira dentro de mi alma y podrás encontrar oro y quizás te vuelvas rico
Mira dentro de tu alma y podrás descubrir que nunca existió
Puedo sentir los cambios
Puedo sentir una nueva vida, siempre supe que la vida puede ser peligrosa
Puedo decir que me gusta el reto y tú me dices que es indoloro
Tú no sabes lo que es el dolor
Cómo puedo pintar este cuadro
Cuando tú eres daltónico?
Cayó en mi cara y desperté con una cicatriz
Otro error viviendo profundo en mi corazón
Admito mis errores sin problema
Puedo admitir que se parecen a los que tú cometiste
Por qué estás resentido cada vez que lo hago?
Dime otra vez que tu objetivo es baladí
Pero hasta un pequeño mechero puede hacer arder un puente
Incluso un pequeño mechero puede hacer arder un puente
Puedo sentir los cambios
Puedo sentir que hay gente nueva alrededor de mí que solamente quieren ganar fama
Puedes ver que mi ciudad me descubrió
Y me puso sobre los escenarios, para mí eso es increíble
Para ti eso es sólo una prueba rápida
Con toda la falta de respeto déjame decir esto
Soy un pecador, que probablemente va a pecar de nuevo
Señor, perdóname
Señor, perdóname
Hay cosas que no comprendo
A veces necesito estar solo
Perra, no jodas mi vibra
Perra, no jodas mi vibra
Puedo sentir tu energía desde dos planetas de distancia
Tengo mi bebida, tengo mi música
La compartiría, pero hoy estoy gritando
Perra, no destroces mi vibra
Perra, no destroces mi vibra
Perra, no destroces mi vibra
Perra, no destroces mi vibra
Estoy intentando mantenerlo vivo
Sin comprometer los sentimientos que amamos
Tú estás intentando mantenerlo deficiente
Y solo firmando contratos con lo que hacen en las radios
Te estoy mirando más allá de ti
Vivimos en un mundo, vivimos en un mundo con dos ejes diferentes
Tú vives en un mundo, tú vives detrás del espejo
Conozco las cosas que te dan miedo
La sensación de sentir emociones inferiores
Esta mierda es vital, sé que tú tenías que
Esta mierda es vital, sé que tú tenías que
Morir en vano, hablarme sobre un reloj y una cadena
Es mucho más creíble, dame alguna ganancia factible
En lugar de un nombre estacional
Dejare que la gente sepa que es algo a lo que puedes echar la culpa
Sobre nosotros, y puedes permanecer encerrado en una caja
Yo escaparé y esconderé cada llave
Yo escaparé y esconderé cada llave
Puedo sentir los cambios
Puedo sentir que hay gente nueva alrededor de mí que solamente quieren ganar fama
Puedes ver que mi ciudad me descubrió
Y me puso sobre los escenarios, para mí eso es increíble
Para ti eso es sólo una prueba rápida
Con toda la falta de respeto déjame decir esto
Soy un pecador, que probablemente va a pecar de nuevo
Señor, perdóname
Señor, perdóname
Hay cosas que no comprendo
A veces necesito estar solo
Perra, no jodas mi vibra
Perra, no jodas mi vibra
Puedo sentir tu energía desde dos planetas de distancia
Tengo mi bebida, tengo mi música
La compartiría, pero hoy estoy gritando
Perra, no destroces mi vibra
Perra, no destroces mi vibra
Perra, no destroces mi vibra
Perra, no destroces mi vibra
Perra, no destroces mi vibra
Hace tiempo que no oías así a la costa
No ves esa larga fila?
Están esperando a Kendrick, como en los días uno y quince
Tres dedos en el aire, puedo ver que estáis sincronizados
Esconde tus sentimientos, esconde tus sentimientos, es lo mejor que puedes hacer
Me llevaré a tu chica y pondré ese chocho sobre un pedestal
Perra, no destroces mi vibra
Perra, no destroces mi vibra
Salen y gritan: “Está vivo”
Mi propósito de año nuevo es detener la contaminación
Que dejen de hablar tanto, tengo mi bebida, tengo mi música
Y digo: perra, no destroces mi vibra
Perra, no destroces mi vibra
Perra, no destroces mi vibra
Perra, no destroces mi vibra
Ayy, K-Dot, entra en el coche, negro!
Venga, vamos a dar una vuelta
Negro, tengo una cajetilla de tabaco negro y un CD de beats
Vamos y te haces unos freestyles!
Every second, every minute
Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
Im talkin about dark room, perfume, go, go
You recognize my fragrance
Yup i know you like the way i smell
You my 2Pac to my janet baby
I would let him get it in a heart beat
I put my hands up high when he
Stick it in baby it feels so good
I know that he want my shit ouu
My shit is so good it make him cum
Very quick and i love it like that
I smell good like rihanna boy
Who can’t resist to hit my big ass
I got a big ass like nicki and it shake good
Like beyoncé he want a bad island girl
To go and suck his dick
Island girls do it better than most
Of the other bitches
I got two men that i am seeing at the same
Time and they both got good shit
But young firm’s is better than ever
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it

I really hope you play this, cause ol girl
You test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations youve been takin
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it dont make sense
Young East African girl, you too
Busy fuckin with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out youre gonna need someone
When you figure out its alright here in the city
And you dont run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life
But goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs
Dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and
We would talk more
They say communication
Save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write em down for real, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just

And theyll forever out ya
Thats why you always quiet
Your the reason people think rap is poetic shit
Bigots winning in our evil ridden justice system
When it come to pistols
These bitches dont john lynch them
And every bitch suddenly
Be rappin bout that trap shit
Im that poetic diabetic i spit sweet try an get it
And it’s beautiful music made by our poetic flows
You chasing hoes, we replacing
Hoes, bag and pass them hoes
Your the criminal this is
Poetic justice, heart is saying fuck this
The irony in that is that i aint even
That, but you put it those pages
Cause it doesnt seem really as simple
Should be poetic or lyrical
Bet i get it quick lick make it backflip
Outta town with some how you gonna act shit
Trying to be illimatic, shoutout to
Lucifer, do justice to that classic
Ever heard of poetic justice?
Bitch im so scandalous
Every second, every minute
Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high

Sto toccando il fondo
Pochi averi da lasciare qui solo in questo mondo
Desideri per stare very good ma sto toccando il fondo
Bella eri come Demi Moore ma era solo uno sfondo
Che non sei tu, non puoi fingere così con me tanto non
Puoi avere nada, volevi andare fuori Italia, io da solo
Prendo il first flight in Kenya, non comprerò una isla
Intera, io non voglio avere nada, non mi interessa manco
Degli altri, leggo le mie chat con mamma, mi manca
Vorrei darle 2 milioni in diamanti, dice stai bene basta questo
Pochi averi da lasciarе qui solo in questo mondo
Desideri pеr stare very good ma sto toccando il fondo
Bella eri come Demi Moore ma era solo uno sfondo
Sai sparisco like Copperfield, dentro ho mostri no Cloverfield
Se sta roba fa male dimmi perché tu combatti aspetta
Che mi ricoveri vedrai fuori una foreign car ma per
Tutto il dolore sarò vuoto più di quella white tee
Con le palme fuori sembra vice city, do the right thing come
Spike Lee, non me ne fotte di quei casini in testa
Ho
I casini e tu quelli più brutti li ricordi tutti
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass , Ima make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, Ima make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They wont take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element
Pochi averi da lasciare qui solo in questo mondo
Desideri per stare very good ma sto toccando il fondo
Bella eri come Demi Moore ma era solo uno sfondo
Im still lost in my own zone in the living room Like Im dead to the world playing Donny Hathaway
Patron shots I consume taking the pain away Each sip bring me closer to my doom
Sun shining bright through the crack in the blind
Thinking to myself this morning what happened to time
Its passing away, the world decides, it aint what it used to be
Everything I love dont mean what it used to mean
For example spitting a 16 No thrills, feeling numb like im of Thorazine
It used to be nicotine, I was addicted to this rap thing
Now Im just trying to trap cream
Enough drowning in my sorrow, never put off tomorrow
What you can do today, thats my new motto
With that said, I roll out the bed
Hit the showers, its time to get this bread, now make dollars
I woke up in the morning, washed my body, put some clothes on it
After that, put on my heat like Alonzo Mourning
Cause everybody got a gun, its like theyre copy cats
So me without one is like Im dated
Id be out of style like Adidas and fat laces
Starter Jackets and dookie ropes or whatever the late 80s had favored
Im one of the best of my Homo Sapiens
One of the best of Gods creations
He shows favoritism everytime you hear the record on radio stations
I know you mad, you aint gotta say much, I can feel you hating
Serving mcs like waitress, Andre Agassi, multitalented
Rapper slash athlete, killing these niggas, theyre screaming in agony
Half of these niggas aint half of me
Half of these niggas aint talking bout nothing, yakity, yakity
Pushing my buttons like plaid shirts, clapping them rapidly
Actually, Kurt, Co-Bain Ten years in my career, pray to God that I dont blow up my brains
Lord, Im here
Great Depression, I dont know much, all I know is studio sessions, and how to get my bars up
They call me Subway sandwich the way i give them cold cuts
Cut from a different cloth, and these Yves Saint Laurent jeans;
They cost so much
 Usher
Either way im caught up in materialistic
Anything thats custom, best believe Imma get it
Getting tired of it and get rid of it, dont step on the Compton premises without your weap-on on your hip
The home of the stray bullet that murder the innocent
No matter the crime rate I still remain content
Moving at my own pace, cause if it dont make dollars
Then it really dont make sense, and if you cant comprehend
I holler like a rottweiler behind a backyard fence
 - x4
I woke up this morning, counting my cash
Girls calling me now, straight throwing the ass
I threw on my T, I grabbed my bitch
Laced up my chucks, rock sharp as a piece
They used to call me a creature, but now Im a beast
With my voice on the beat, Im the voice of the streets
From my head to the feet, Im bad to the bone
Nigga, I wont stop, till Im add to the throne
Dog, I ride with the chrome, gotta be safe in this shit
Call me Pharrell, boy, I keep me them Clipse I dont ride on no skateboard, I roll with some grinders
Trapped in the hood, far from Giligans Island
I was a drug dealer, but now Im a wild spitter
Nigga, Im more iller, call me a hospital
You got the hiccups, I got this fluent as shit nigga
I spit a bar, straight ruin your shit nigga
Known as a mack, I can influence your bitch
Im the reason these niggas be handcuffin them quick
Im the reason these bitch niggas be playa hating on us
See them in the streets, these niggas dont be saying nothing
But keep on talking, you aint ready for beef
Jay Rock down to bust a nigga head in the streets
I cant help it, the hood flow through my blood
This gangbangin shit, should be considered a drug
Everybody doing it now, I see you rap niggas
Wrong place, wrong time, thats how you get clapped nigga
Raised in the projects, money my object
They standing in my way, like a frog I dissect them
Youll get shot walking through my section
Now you a verse all in my session, they say life is a school
Everyday is a lesson, well I get kicked out, shit got me guessing
Shit naw, check my ghetto report card, straight A student in every class up in the Gardens
Money over bitches, nigga im heartless
Money over bitch niggas, rich is my target
 - x

Got my own stash, boy I my own grass

Motherfucker, you can live at the mall

Digging in my pocket, aint a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... hey

Too afraid of a lot of changes

Dark nights in my prayers
